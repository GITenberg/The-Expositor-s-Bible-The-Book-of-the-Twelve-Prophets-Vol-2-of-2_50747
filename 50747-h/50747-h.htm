<p class="noindent">
The first volume on the Twelve Prophets dealt
with the three who belonged to the Eighth
Century: Amos, Hosea and Micah. This second
volume includes the other nine books arranged in
chronological order: Zephaniah, Nahum and Habakkuk,
of the Seventh Century; Obadiah, of the Exile;
Haggai, Zechariah i.—viii., “Malachi” and Joel, of
the Persian Period, 538—331; “Zechariah” ix.—xiv.
and the Book of Jonah, of the Greek Period, which
began in 332, the date of Alexander’s Syrian campaign.
</p>

<p>
The same plan has been followed as in Volume I.
A historical introduction is offered to each period.
To each prophet are given, first a chapter of critical
introduction, and then one or more chapters of exposition.
A complete translation has been furnished,
with critical and explanatory notes. All questions
of date and of text, and nearly all of interpretation,
have been confined to the introductions and the
notes, so that those who consult the volume only
for expository purposes will find the exposition unencumbered
by the discussion of technical points.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>
The necessity of including within one volume so
many prophets, scattered over more than three
centuries, and each of them requiring a separate
introduction, has reduced the space available for the
practical application of their teaching to modern life.
But this is the less to be regretted, that the contents
of the nine books before us are not so applicable
to our own day, as we have found their greater
predecessors to be. On the other hand, however,
they form a more varied introduction to Old Testament
Criticism, while, by the long range of time which they
cover, and the many stages of religion to which they
belong, they afford a wider view of the development
of prophecy. Let us look for a little at these two
points.
</p>

<p>
1. To Old Testament Criticism these books furnish
valuable introduction—some of them, like Obadiah, Joel
and “Zechariah” ix.—xiv., by the great variety of
opinion that has prevailed as to their dates or their
relation to other prophets with whom they have passages
in common; some, like Zechariah and “Malachi,”
by their relation to the Law, in the light of modern
theories of the origin of the latter; and some, like
Joel and Jonah, by the question whether we are to
read them as history, or as allegories of history,
or as apocalypse. That is to say, these nine books
raise, besides the usual questions of genuineness
and integrity, every other possible problem of Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Testament Criticism. It has, therefore, been necessary
to make the critical introductions full and detailed.
The enormous differences of opinion as to the dates
of some must start the suspicion of arbitrariness, unless
there be included in each case a history of the development
of criticism, so as to exhibit to the English reader
the principles and the evidence of fact upon which
that criticism is based. I am convinced that what
is chiefly required just now by the devout student of
the Bible is the opportunity to judge for himself how
far Old Testament Criticism is an adult science; with
what amount of reasonableness it has been prosecuted;
how gradually its conclusions have been reached, how
jealously they have been contested; and how far,
amid the many varieties of opinion which must
always exist with reference to facts so ancient and
questions so obscure, there has been progress towards
agreement upon the leading problems. But, besides
the accounts of past criticism given in this volume,
the reader will find in each case an independent
attempt to arrive at a conclusion. This has not always
been successful. A number of points have been left
in doubt; and even where results have been stated
with some degree of positiveness, the reader need
scarcely be warned (after what was said in the Preface
to Vol. I.) that many of these must necessarily
be provisional. But, in looking back from the close
of this work upon the discussions which it contains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
I am more than ever convinced of the extreme probability
of most of the conclusions. Among these
are the following: that the correct interpretation of
Habakkuk is to be found in the direction of the position
to which Budde’s ingenious proposal has been
carried on pages 123 ff. with reference to Egypt; that
the most of Obadiah is to be dated from the sixth
century; that “Malachi” is an anonymous work
from the eve of Ezra’s reforms; that Joel follows
“Malachi”; and that “Zechariah” ix.—xiv. has been
rightly assigned by Stade to the early years of the
Greek Period. I have ventured to contest Kosters’
theory that there was no return of Jewish exiles under
Cyrus, and am the more disposed to believe his
strong argument inconclusive, not only upon a review
of the reasons I have stated in Chap. XVI., but on this
ground also, that many of its chief adherents in this
country and Germany have so modified it as virtually
to give up its main contention. I think, too, there
can be little doubt as to the substantial authenticity
of Zephaniah ii. (except the verses on Moab and
Ammon) and iii. 1–13, of Habakkuk ii. 5 ff., and of the
whole of Haggai; or as to the ungenuine character of
the lyric piece in Zechariah ii. and the intrusion of
“Malachi” ii. 11–13<i>a</i>. On these and smaller points
the reader will find full discussion at the proper places.

[I may here add a word or two upon some of the
critical conclusions reached in Vol. I., which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
been recently contested. The student will find strong
grounds offered by Canon Driver in his <i>Joel and
Amos</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the authenticity of those passages in Amos
which, following other critics, I regarded or suspected
as not authentic. It makes one diffident in one’s
opinions when Canon Driver supports Professors
Kuenen and Robertson Smith on the other side.
But on a survey of the case I am unable to feel that
even they have removed what they admit to be
“forcible” objections to the authorship by Amos of
the passages in question. They seem to me to have
established not more than a possibility that the
passages are authentic; and on the whole I still feel
that the probability is in the other direction. If I am
right, then I think that the date of the apostrophes
to Jehovah’s creative power which occur in the
Book of Amos, and the reference to astral deities in
chap. v. 27, may be that which I have suggested on
pages 8 and 9 of this volume. Some critics have
charged me with inconsistency in denying the authenticity
of the epilogue to Amos while defending that
of the epilogue to Hosea. The two cases, as my
arguments proved, are entirely different. Nor do I
see any reason to change the conclusions of Vol. I.
upon the questions of the authenticity of various
parts of Micah.]
</p>

<p>The text of the nine prophets treated in this volume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
has presented even more difficulties than that of the
three treated in Vol. I. And these difficulties must
be my apology for the delay of this volume.
</p>

<p>
2. But the critical and textual value of our nine
books is far exceeded by the historical. Each exhibits
a development of Hebrew prophecy of the greatest
interest. From this point of view, indeed, the volume
might be entitled “The Passing of the Prophet.”
For throughout our nine books we see the spirit
and the style of the classic prophecy of Israel
gradually dissolving into other forms of religious
thought and feeling. The clear start from the facts
of the prophet’s day, the ancient truths about
Jehovah and Israel, and the direct appeal to the
conscience of the prophet’s contemporaries, are not
always given, or when given are mingled, coloured
and warped by other religious interests, both present
and future, which are even powerful enough to shake
the ethical absolutism of the older prophets. With
Nahum and Obadiah the ethical is entirely missed
in the presence of the claims—and we cannot deny
that they were natural claims—of the long-suffering
nation’s hour of revenge upon her heathen tyrants.
With Zephaniah prophecy, still austerely ethical,
passes under the shadow of apocalypse; and the
future is solved, not upon purely historical lines, but by
the intervention of “supernatural” elements. With
Habakkuk the ideals of the older prophets encounter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
the shock of the facts of experience: we have the
prophet as sceptic. Upon the other margin of the
Exile, Haggai and Zechariah (i.—viii.), although they
are as practical as any of their predecessors, exhibit
the influence of the exilic developments of ritual,
angelology and apocalypse. God appears further off
from Zechariah than from the prophets of the eighth
century, and in need of mediators, human and superhuman.
With Zechariah the priest has displaced
the prophet, and it is very remarkable that no place
is found for the latter beside <i>the two sons of oil</i>, the
political and priestly heads of the community, who,
according to the Fifth Vision, stand in the presence
of God and between them feed the religious life
of Israel. Nearly sixty years later “Malachi” exhibits
the working of Prophecy within the Law, and
begins to employ the didactic style of the later Rabbinism.
Joel starts, like any older prophet, from the
facts of his own day, but these hurry him at once
into apocalypse; he calls, as thoroughly as any of
his predecessors, to repentance, but under the imminence
of the Day of the Lord, with its “supernatural”
terrors, he mentions no special sin and enforces no
single virtue. The civic and personal ethics of the
earlier prophets are absent. In the Greek Period,
the oracles now numbered from the ninth to the
fourteenth chapters of the Book of Zechariah repeat
to aggravation the exulting revenge of Nahum and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Obadiah, without the strong style or the hold upon
history which the former exhibits, and show us
prophecy still further enwrapped in apocalypse. But
in the Book of Jonah, though it is parable and
not history, we see a great recovery and expansion
of the best elements of prophecy. God’s character
and Israel’s true mission to the world are revealed in
the spirit of Hosea and of the Seer of the Exile, with
much of the tenderness, the insight, the analysis of
character and even the humour of classic prophecy.
These qualities raise the Book of Jonah, though it
is probably the latest of our Twelve, to the highest
rank among them. No book is more worthy to stand
by the side of Isaiah xl.—lv.; none is nearer in
spirit to the New Testament.
</p>

<p>
All this gives unity to the study of prophets so far
separate in time, and so very distinct in character, from
each other. From Zephaniah to Jonah, or over a period
of three centuries, they illustrate the dissolution of
Prophecy and its passage into other forms of religion.
</p>

<p>
The scholars, to whom every worker in this field
is indebted, are named throughout the volume. I
regret that Nowack’s recent commentary on the Minor
Prophets (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht)
reached me too late for use (except in footnotes) upon
the earlier of the nine prophets.

<p class="captitle">THE SEVENTH CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST</p>

<p class="noindent">The three prophets who were treated in the first
volume of this work belonged to the eighth century
before Christ: if Micah lived into the seventh his
labours were over by 675. The next group of our
twelve, also three in number, Zephaniah, Nahum and
Habakkuk, did not appear till after 630. To make our
study continuous<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> we must now sketch the course
of Israel’s history between.</p>

<p>In another volume of this series,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> some account was
given of the religious progress of Israel from Isaiah
and the Deliverance of Jerusalem in 701 to Jeremiah
and the Fall of Jerusalem in 587. Isaiah’s strength
was bent upon establishing the inviolableness of Zion.
Zion, he said, should not be taken, and the people,
though cut to their roots, should remain planted in their
own land, the stock of a noble nation in the latter
days. But Jeremiah predicted the ruin both of City
and Temple, summoned Jerusalem’s enemies against
her in the name of Jehovah, and counselled his people
to submit to them. This reversal of the prophetic
ideal had a twofold reason. In the first place the
moral condition of Israel was worse in 600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> than it
had been in 700; another century had shown how
much the nation needed the penalty and purgation of
exile. But secondly, however the inviolableness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Jerusalem had been required in the interests of pure
religion in 701, religion had now to show that it was
independent even of Zion and of Israel’s political
survival. Our three prophets of the eighth century
(as well as Isaiah himself) had indeed preached a gospel
which implied this, but it was reserved to Jeremiah to
prove that the existence of state and temple was not
indispensable to faith in God, and to explain the ruin
of Jerusalem, not merely as a well-merited penance,
but as the condition of a more spiritual intercourse
between Jehovah and His people.</p>

<p>It is our duty to trace the course of events through
the seventh century, which led to this change of the
standpoint of prophecy, and which moulded the messages
especially of Jeremiah’s contemporaries, Zephaniah,
Nahum and Habakkuk. We may divide the century
into three periods: <i>First</i>, that of the Reaction and
Persecution under Manasseh and Amon, from 695
or 690 to 639, during which prophecy was silent or
anonymous; <i>Second</i>, that of the Early Years of Josiah,
639 to 625, near the end of which we meet with the
young Jeremiah and Zephaniah; <i>Third</i>, the Rest of
the Century, 625 to 600, covering the Decline and Fall
of Niniveh, and the prophets Nahum and Habakkuk,
with an addition carrying on the history to the Fall of
Jerusalem in 587—6.</p>

<p>Jerusalem was delivered in 701, and the Assyrians
kept away from Palestine for twenty-three years.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Judah had peace, and Hezekiah was free to devote his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
latter days to the work of purifying the worship of his
people. What he exactly achieved is uncertain. The
historian imputes to him the removal of the high places,
the destruction of all Maççeboth and Asheras, and of
the brazen serpent.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That his measures were drastic
is probable from the opinions of Isaiah, who was their
inspiration, and proved by the reaction which they provoked
when Hezekiah died. The <i>removal</i> of the high
places and the concentration of the national worship
within the Temple would be the more easy that the
provincial sanctuaries had been devastated by the
Assyrian invasion, and that the shrine of Jehovah was
glorified by the raising of the siege of 701.</p>

<p>While the first of Isaiah’s great postulates for the
future, the inviolableness of Zion, had been fulfilled, the
second, the reign of a righteous prince in Israel, seemed
doomed to disappointment. Hezekiah died early in
the seventh century,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and was succeeded by his son
Manasseh, a boy of twelve, who appears to have been
captured by the party whom his father had opposed.
The few years’ peace—peace in Israel was always
dangerous to the health of the higher religion—the interests
of those who had suffered from the reforms, the
inevitable reaction which a rigorous puritanism provokes—these
swiftly reversed the religious fortunes of Israel.
Isaiah’s and Micah’s predictions of the final overthrow
of Assyria seemed falsified, when in 681 the more
vigorous Asarhaddon succeeded Sennacherib, and in
678 swept the long absent armies back upon Syria.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Sidon was destroyed, and twenty-two princes of
Palestine immediately yielded their tribute to the conqueror.
Manasseh was one of them, and his political
homage may have brought him, as it brought Ahaz,
within the infection of foreign idolatries.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Everything,
in short, worked for the revival of that eclectic paganism
which Hezekiah had striven to stamp out. The high
places were rebuilt; altars were erected to Baal, with
the sacred pole of Asherah, as in the time of Ahab;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
shrines to the <i>host of heaven</i> defiled the courts of
Jehovah’s house; there was a recrudescence of soothsaying,
divination and traffic with the dead.</p>

<p>But it was all very different from the secure and
sunny temper which Amos had encountered in Northern
Israel.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The terrible Assyrian invasions had come
between. Life could never again feel so stable. Still
more destructive had been the social poisons which
our prophets described as sapping the constitution of
Israel for nearly three generations. The rural simplicity
was corrupted by those economic changes which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Micah bewails. With the ousting of the old families
from the soil, a thousand traditions, memories and
habits must have been broken, which had preserved
the people’s presence of mind in days of sudden
disaster, and had carried them, for instance, through so
long a trial as the Syrian wars. Nor could the blood
of Israel have run so pure after the luxury and
licentiousness described by Hosea and Isaiah. The
novel obligations of commerce, the greed to be rich,
the increasing distress among the poor, had strained
the joyous temper of that nation of peasants’ sons,
whom we met with Amos, and shattered the nerves
of their rulers. There is no word of fighting in
Manasseh’s days, no word of revolt against the tyrant.
Perhaps also the intervening puritanism, which had
failed to give the people a permanent faith, had
at least awakened within them a new conscience.</p>

<p>At all events there is now no more <i>ease in Zion</i>, but
a restless fear, driving the people to excesses of
religious zeal. We do not read of the happy country
festivals of the previous century, nor of the careless
pride of that sudden wealth which built vast palaces
and loaded the altar of Jehovah with hecatombs. The
full-blooded patriotism, which at least kept ritual in
touch with clean national issues, has vanished. The
popular religion is sullen and exasperated. It takes
the form of sacrifices of frenzied cruelty and lust.
Children are passed through the fire to Moloch, and
the Temple is defiled by the orgies of those who abuse
their bodies to propitiate a foreign and a brutal god.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>But the most certain consequence of a religion whose
nerves are on edge is persecution, and this raged all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the earlier years of Manasseh. The adherents of the
purer faith were slaughtered, and Jerusalem drenched<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
with innocent blood. Her <i>own sword</i>, says Jeremiah,
<i>devoured the prophets like a destroying lion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It is significant that all that has come down to us
from this “killing time” is anonymous;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> we do not
meet with our next group of public prophets till
Manasseh and his like-minded son have passed away.
Yet prophecy was not wholly stifled. Voices were
raised to predict the exile and destruction of the
nation. <i>Jehovah spake by His servants</i>;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> while others
wove into the prophecies of an Amos, a Hosea or an
Isaiah some application of the old principles to the
new circumstances. It is probable, for instance, that
the extremely doubtful passage in the Book of Amos,
v. 26 f., which imputes to Israel as a whole the worship
of astral deities from Assyria, is to be assigned to the
reign of Manasseh. In its present position it looks
very like an intrusion: nowhere else does Amos charge
his generation with serving foreign gods; and certainly
in all the history of Israel we could not find a more
suitable period for so specific a charge than the
days when into the central sanctuary of the national
worship images were introduced of the host of heaven,
and the nation was, in consequence, threatened with
exile.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>In times of persecution the documents of the suffering
faith have ever been reverenced and guarded with
especial zeal. It is not improbable that the prophets,
driven from public life, gave themselves to the arrangement
of the national scriptures; and some critics date
from Manasseh’s reign the weaving of the two earliest
documents of the Pentateuch into one continuous book
of history.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Book of Deuteronomy forms a problem
by itself. The legislation which composes the bulk
of it<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> appears to have been found among the Temple
archives at the end of our period, and presented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Josiah as an old and forgotten work.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> There is no
reason to charge with fraud those who made the presentation
by affirming that they really invented the
book. They were priests of Jerusalem, but the book is
written by members of the prophetic party, and ostensibly
in the interests of the priests of the country. It
betrays no tremor of the awful persecutions of
Manasseh’s reign; it does not hint at the distinction,
then for the first time apparent, between a false and
a true Israel. But it does draw another distinction,
familiar to the eighth century, between the true and
the false prophets. The political and spiritual premisses
of the doctrine of the book were all present by the
end of the reign of Hezekiah, and it is extremely
improbable that his reforms, which were in the main
those of Deuteronomy, were not accompanied by some
code, or by some appeal to the fountain of all law
in Israel.</p>

<p>But whether the Book of Deuteronomy now existed
or not, there were those in the nation who through all
the dark days between Hezekiah and Josiah laid up
its truth in their hearts and were ready to assist the
latter monarch in his public enforcement of it.</p>

<p>While these things happened within Judah, very
great events were taking place beyond her borders.
Asarhaddon of Assyria (681—668) was a monarch
of long purposes and thorough plans. Before he
invaded Egypt, he spent a year (675) in subduing the
restless tribes of Northern Arabia, and another (674) in
conquering the peninsula of Sinai, an ancient appanage
of Egypt. Tyre upon her island baffled his assaults,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
but the rest of Palestine remained subject to him.
He received his reward in carrying the Assyrian arms
farther into Egypt than any of his predecessors, and
about 670 took Memphis from the Ethiopian Pharaoh
Taharka. Then he died. Assurbanipal, who succeeded,
lost Egypt for a few years, but about 665,
with the help of his tributaries in Palestine, he overthrew
Taharka, took Thebes, and established along
the Nile a series of vassal states. He quelled a revolt
there in 663 and overthrew Memphis for a second
time. The fall of the Egyptian capital resounds
through the rest of the century; we shall hear its
echoes in Nahum. Tyre fell at last with Arvad in
662. But the Assyrian empire had grown too vast
for human hands to grasp, and in 652 a general revolt
took place in Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Elam, Babylon
and Asia Minor. In 649 Assurbanipal reduced Elam
and Babylon; and by two further campaigns (647 and
645) Hauran, Edom, Ammon, Moab, Nabatea and all
the northern Arabs. On his return from these he
crossed Western Palestine to the sea and punished
Usu and Akko. It is very remarkable that, while
Assurbanipal, who thus fought the neighbours of Judah,
makes no mention of her, nor numbers Manasseh among
the rebels whom he chastised, the Book of Chronicles
should contain the statement that <i>Jehovah sent upon
Manasseh the captains of the host of the king of Assyria,
who bound him with fetters and carried him to Babylon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
What grounds the Chronicler had for such a statement
are quite unknown to us. He introduces Manasseh’s
captivity as the consequence of idolatry, and asserts
that on his restoration Manasseh abolished in Judah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
all worship save that of Jehovah, but if this happened
(and the Book of Kings has no trace of it) it was
without result. Amon, son of Manasseh, continued
to sacrifice to all the images which his father had
introduced.</p>

     Z<span class="small">EPHANIAH</span>.</h4>

<p>Amon had not reigned for two years when <i>his
servants conspired against him, and he was slain in his
own house</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But the <i>people of the land</i> rose against
the court, slew the conspirators, and secured the throne
for Amon’s son, Josiah, a child of eight. It is difficult
to know what we ought to understand by these movements.
Amon, who was slain, was an idolater; the
popular party, who slew his slayers, put his son on
the throne, and that son, unlike both his father and
grandfather, bore a name compounded with the name
of Jehovah. Was Amon then slain for personal
reasons? Did the people, in their rising, have a zeal
for Jehovah? Was the crisis purely political, but
usurped by some school or party of Jehovah who had
been gathering strength through the later years of
Manasseh, and waiting for some such unsettlement of
affairs as now occurred? The meagre records of the
Bible give us no help, and for suggestions towards an
answer we must turn to the wider politics of the time.</p>

<p>Assurbanipal’s campaigns of 647 and 645 were the
last appearances of Assyria in Palestine. He had not
attempted to reconquer Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and her king, Psamtik I.,
began to push his arms northward. Progress must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
have been slow, for the siege of Ashdod, which Psamtik
probably began after 645, is said to have occupied him
twenty-nine years. Still, he must have made his influence
to be felt in Palestine, and in all probability
there was once more, as in the days of Isaiah, an
Egyptian party in Jerusalem. As the power of Assyria
receded over the northern horizon, the fascination of her
idolatries, which Manasseh had established in Judah,
must have waned. The priests of Jehovah’s house,
jostled by their pagan rivals, would be inclined to make
common cause with the prophets under a persecution
which both had suffered. With the loosening of the
Assyrian yoke the national spirit would revive, and it is
easy to imagine prophets, priests and people working
together in the movement which placed the child Josiah
on the throne. At his tender age, he must have been
wholly in the care of the women of the royal house;
and among these the influence of the prophets may
have found adherents more readily than among the
counsellors of an adult prince. Not only did the new
monarch carry the name of Jehovah in his own; this
was the case also with his mother’s father.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In the
revolt, therefore, which raised this unconscious child
to the throne and in the circumstances which moulded
his character, we may infer that there already existed
the germs of the great work of reform which his
manhood achieved.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>For some time little change would be possible, but
from the first facts were working for great issues.
The Book of Kings, which places the destruction of the
idols after the discovery of the law-book in the eighteenth
year of Josiah’s reign, records a previous
cleansing and restoration of the house of Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
This points to the growing ascendency of the prophetic
party during the first fifteen years of Josiah’s reign.
Of the first ten years we know nothing, except that the
prestige of Assyria was waning; but this fact, along
with the preaching of the prophets, who had neither
a native tyrant nor the exigencies of a foreign alliance
to silence them, must have weaned the people from the
worship of the Assyrian idols. Unless these had been
discredited, the repair of Jehovah’s house could hardly
have been attempted; and that this progressed means
that part of Josiah’s destruction of the heathen images
took place before the discovery of the Book of the Law,
which happened in consequence of the cleansing of the
Temple.</p>

<p>But just as under the good Hezekiah the social
condition of the people, and especially the behaviour
of the upper classes, continued to be bad, so it was
again in the early years of Josiah. There was a
<i>remnant of Baal</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in the land. The shrines of <i>the host
of heaven</i> might have been swept from the Temple, but
they were still worshipped from the housetops.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Men
swore by the Queen of Heaven, and by Moloch, the
King. Some turned back from Jehovah; some, grown
up in idolatry, had not yet sought Him. Idolatry may
have been disestablished from the national sanctuary:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
its practices still lingered (how intelligibly to us!) in
social and commercial life. Foreign fashions were
affected by the court and nobility; trade, as always,
was combined with the acknowledgment of foreign
gods.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Moreover, the rich were fraudulent and cruel.
The ministers of justice, and the great in the land,
ravened among the poor. Jerusalem was full of oppression.
These were the same disorders as Amos and
Hosea exposed in Northern Israel, and as Micah
exposed in Jerusalem. But one new trait of evil was
added. In the eighth century, with all their ignorance
of Jehovah’s true character, men had yet believed in
Him, gloried in His energy, and expected Him to act—were
it only in accordance with their low ideals. They
had been alive and bubbling with religion. But now
they <i>had thickened on their lees</i>. They had grown
sceptical, dull, indifferent; they said in their hearts,
<i>Jehovah will not do good, neither will He do evil!</i></p>

<p>Now, just as in the eighth century there had risen,
contemporaneous with Israel’s social corruption, a cloud
in the north, black and pregnant with destruction,
so was it once more. But the cloud was not Assyria.
From the hidden world beyond her, from the regions
over Caucasus, vast, nameless hordes of men arose, and,
sweeping past her unchecked, poured upon Palestine.
This was the great Scythian invasion recorded by
Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> We have almost no other report than his
few paragraphs, but we can realise the event from our
knowledge of the Mongol and Tartar invasions which
in later centuries pursued the same path southwards.
Living in the saddle, and (it would seem) with no
infantry nor chariots to delay them, these Centaurs
swept on with a speed of invasion hitherto unknown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
In 630 they had crossed the Caucasus, by 626 they
were on the borders of Egypt. Psamtik I. succeeded
in purchasing their retreat,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and they swept back again
as swiftly as they came. They must have followed the
old Assyrian war-paths of the eighth century, and, without
foot-soldiers, had probably kept even more closely
to the plains. In Palestine their way would lie, like
Assyria’s, across Hauran, through the plain of Esdraelon,
and down the Philistine coast, and in fact it is only on
this line that there exists any possible trace of them.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
But they shook the whole of Palestine into consternation.
Though Judah among her hills escaped them, as she
escaped the earlier campaigns of Assyria, they showed
her the penal resources of her offended God. Once
again the dark, sacred North was seen to be full of
the possibilities of doom.</p>

<p>Behold, therefore, exactly the two conditions, ethical
and political, which, as we saw, called forth the sudden
prophets of the eighth century, and made them so sure
of their message of judgment: on the one side Judah,
her sins calling aloud for punishment; on the other
side the forces of punishment swiftly drawing on. It
was precisely at this juncture that prophecy again arose,
and as Amos, Hosea, Micah and Isaiah appeared in
the end of the eighth century, Zephaniah, Habakkuk,
Nahum and Jeremiah appeared in the end of the
seventh. The coincidence is exact, and a remarkable
confirmation of the truth which we deduced from the
experience of Amos, that the assurance of the prophet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in Israel arose from the coincidence of his conscience
with his political observation. The justice of Jehovah
demands His people’s chastisement, but see—the forces
of chastisement are already upon the horizon. Zephaniah
uses the same phrase as Amos: <i>the Day of
Jehovah</i>, he says, <i>is drawing near</i>.</p>

<p>We are now in touch with Zephaniah, the first of
our prophets, but, before listening to him, it will be
well to complete our survey of those remaining years
of the century in which he and his immediate successors
laboured.</p>

   N<span class="small">INIVEH</span>;
   N<span class="small">AHUM AND</span>
   H<span class="small">ABAKKUK</span>.</h4>

<p>Although the Scythians had vanished from the
horizon of Palestine and the Assyrians came over it
no more, the fateful North still lowered dark and
turbulent. Yet the keen eyes of the watchmen in
Palestine perceived that, for a time at least, the storm
must break where it had gathered. It is upon Niniveh,
not upon Jerusalem, that the prophetic passion of
Nahum and Habakkuk is concentrated; the new day
of the Lord is filled with the fate, not of Israel, but of
Assyria.</p>

<p>For nearly two centuries Niniveh had been the
capital and cynosure of Western Asia; for more than
one she had set the fashions, the art, and even, to some
extent, the religion of all the Semitic nations. Of late
years, too, she had drawn to herself the world’s trade.
Great roads from Egypt, from Persia and from the
Ægean converged upon her, till like Imperial Rome
she was filled with a vast motley of peoples, and
men went forth from her to the ends of the earth.
Under Assurbanipal travel and research had increased,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and the city acquired renown as the centre of the
world’s wisdom. Thus her size and glory, with all
her details of rampart and tower, street, palace and
temple, grew everywhere familiar. But the peoples
gazed at her as those who had been bled to build her.
The most remote of them had seen face to face on
their own fields, trampling, stripping, burning, the
warriors who manned her walls. She had dashed
their little ones against the rocks. Their kings had
been dragged from them and hung in cages about her
gates. Their gods had lined the temples of her gods.
Year by year they sent her their heavy tribute, and the
bearers came back with fresh tales of her rapacious
insolence. So she stood, bitterly clear to all men,
in her glory and her cruelty! Their hate haunted her
every pinnacle; and at last, when about 625 the news
came that her frontier fortresses had fallen and the great
city herself was being besieged, we can understand
how her victims gloated on each possible stage of her
fall, and saw her yield to one after another of the
cruelties of battle, siege and storm, which for two
hundred years she had inflicted on themselves. To
such a vision the prophet Nahum gives voice, not on
behalf of Israel alone, but of all the nations whom
Niniveh had crushed.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the vengeance which Western
Asia thus hailed upon Assyria must come from one
or other of two groups of peoples, standing respectively
to the north and to the south of her.</p>

<p>To the north, or north-east, between Mesopotamia
and the Caspian, there were gathered a congeries
of restless tribes known to the Assyrians as the
Madai or Matai, the Medes. They are mentioned first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
by Shalmaneser II. in 840, and few of his successors
do not record campaigns against them. The earliest
notice of them in the Old Testament is in connection
with the captives of Samaria, some of whom
in 720 were settled among them.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> These Medes were
probably of Turanian stock, but by the end of the
eighth century, if we are to judge from the names of
some of their chiefs,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> their most easterly tribes had
already fallen under Aryan influence, spreading westward
from Persia.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> So led, they became united and
formidable to Assyria. Herodotus relates that their
King Phraortes, or Fravartis, actually attempted the
siege of Niniveh, probably on the death of Assurbanipal
in 625, but was slain.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> His son Kyaxares,
Kastarit or Uvakshathra, was forced by a Scythian
invasion of his own country to withdraw his troops
from Assyria; but having either bought off or assimilated
the Scythian invaders, he returned in 608, with
forces sufficient to overthrow the northern Assyrian
fortresses and to invest Niniveh herself.</p>

<p>The other and southern group of peoples which
threatened Assyria were Semitic. At their head were
the Kasdim or Chaldeans.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This name appears for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the first time in the Assyrian annals a little earlier than
that of the Medes,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and from the middle of the ninth
century onwards the people designated by it frequently
engage the Assyrian arms. They were, to begin with,
a few half-savage tribes to the south of Babylon, in
the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf; but they proved
their vigour by the repeated lordship of all Babylonia
and by inveterate rebellion against the monarchs of
Niniveh. Before the end of the seventh century we find
their names used by the prophets for the Babylonians
as a whole. Assurbanipal, who was a patron of
Babylonian culture, kept the country quiet during the
last years of his reign, but his son Asshur-itil-ilani,
upon his accession in 625, had to grant the viceroyalty
to Nabopolassar the Chaldean with a considerable
degree of independence. Asshur-itil-ilani was succeeded
in a few years<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> by Sinsuriskin, the Sarakos of
the Greeks, who preserved at least a nominal sovereignty
over Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but Nabopolassar must already
have cherished ambitions of succeeding the Assyrian
in the empire of the world. He enjoyed sufficient
freedom to organise his forces to that end.</p>

<p>These were the two powers which from north and
south watched with impatience the decay of Assyria.
That they made no attempt upon her between 625 and
608 was probably due to several causes: their jealousy
of each other, the Medes’ trouble with the Scythians,
Nabopolassar’s genius for waiting till his forces were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ready, and above all the still considerable vigour of the
Assyrian himself. The Lion, though old,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> was not
broken. His power may have relaxed in the distant
provinces of his empire, though, if Budde be right
about the date of Habakkuk,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> the peoples of Syria still
groaned under the thought of it; but his own land—his
<i>lair</i>, as the prophets call it—was still terrible. It
is true that, as Nahum perceives, the capital was no
longer native and patriotic as it had been; the trade
fostered by Assurbanipal had filled Niniveh with a
vast and mercenary population, ready to break and
disperse at the first breach in her walls. Yet Assyria
proper was covered with fortresses, and the tradition
had long fastened upon the peoples that Niniveh was
impregnable. Hence the tension of those years. The
peoples of Western Asia looked eagerly for their revenge;
but the two powers which alone could accomplish this
stood waiting—afraid of each other perhaps, but more
afraid of the object of their common ambition.</p>

<p>It is said that Kyaxares and Nabopolassar at last
came to an agreement;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> but more probably the crisis
was hastened by the appearance of another claimant
for the coveted spoil. In 608 Pharaoh Necho <i>went up
against the king of Assyria towards the river Euphrates</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
This Egyptian advance may have forced the hand of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Kyaxares, who appears to have begun his investment
of Niniveh a little after Necho defeated Josiah at
Megiddo<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. The siege is said to have lasted two years.
Whether this included the delays necessary for the
reduction of fortresses upon the great roads of approach
to the Assyrian capital we do not know; but Niniveh’s
own position, fortifications and resources may well
account for the whole of the time. Colonel Billerbeck,
a military expert, has suggested<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that the Medes found
it possible to invest the city only upon the northern
and eastern sides. Down the west flows the Tigris,
and across this the besieged may have been able to
bring in supplies and reinforcements from the fertile
country beyond. Herodotus affirms that the Medes
effected the capture of Niniveh by themselves,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and
for this some recent evidence has been found,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> so that
another tradition that the Chaldeans were also actively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
engaged,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which has nothing to support it, may be
regarded as false. Nabopolassar may still have been
in name an Assyrian viceroy; yet, as Colonel Billerbeck
points out, he had it in his power to make Kyaxares’
victory possible by holding the southern roads to
Niniveh, detaching other viceroys of her provinces and
so shutting her up to her own resources. But among
other reasons which kept him away from the siege
may have been the necessity of guarding against
Egyptian designs on the moribund empire. Pharaoh
Necho, as we know, was making for the Euphrates as
early as 608. Now if Nabopolassar and Kyaxares had
arranged to divide Assyria between them, then it is
likely that they agreed also to share the work of
making their inheritance sure, so that while Kyaxares
overthrew Niniveh, Nabopolassar, or rather his son
Nebuchadrezzar,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> waited for and overthrew Pharaoh by
Carchemish on the Euphrates. Consequently Assyria
was divided between the Medes and the Chaldeans;
the latter as her heirs in the south took over her
title to Syria and Palestine.</p>

<p>The two prophets with whom we have to deal at this
time are almost entirely engrossed with the fall of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Assyria. Nahum exults in the destruction of Niniveh;
Habakkuk sees in the Chaldeans nothing but the
avengers of the peoples whom Assyria<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> had oppressed.
For both these events are the close of an epoch: neither
prophet looks beyond this. Nahum (not on behalf of
Israel alone) gives expression to the epoch’s long
thirst for vengeance on the tyrant; Habakkuk (if
Budde’s reading of him be right<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>) states the problems
with which its victorious cruelties had filled the pious
mind—states the problem and beholds the solution in
the Chaldeans. And, surely, the vengeance was so just
and so ample, the solution so drastic and for the time
complete, that we can well understand how two prophets
should exhaust their office in describing such things,
and feel no motive to look either deep into the moral
condition of Israel, or far out into the future which God
was preparing for His people. It might, of course, be
said that the prophets’ silence on the latter subjects
was due to their positions immediately after the great
Reform of 621, when the nation, having been roused
to an honest striving after righteousness, did not require
prophetic rebuke, and when the success of so godly a
prince as Josiah left no spiritual ambitions unsatisfied.
But this (even if the dates of the two prophets were
certain) is hardly probable; and the other explanation
is sufficient. Who can doubt this who has realised
the long epoch which then reached a crisis, or
has been thrilled by the crash of the crisis itself?
The fall of Niniveh was deafening enough to drown
for the moment, as it does in Nahum, even a Hebrew’s
clamant conscience of his country’s sin. The problems,
which the long success of Assyrian cruelty had started,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
were old and formidable enough to demand statement
and answer before either the hopes or the responsibilities
of the future could find voice. The past also
requires its prophets. Feeling has to be satisfied, and
experience balanced, before the heart is willing to turn
the leaf and read the page of the future.</p>

<p>Yet, through all this time of Assyria’s decline, Israel
had her own sins, fears and convictions of judgment
to come. The disappearance of the Scythians did not
leave Zephaniah’s predictions of doom without means
of fulfilment; nor did the great Reform of 621 remove
the necessity of that doom. In the deepest
hearts the assurance that Israel must be punished was
by these things only confirmed. The prophetess
Huldah, the first to speak in the name of the Lord
after the Book of the Law was discovered, emphasised
not the reforms which it enjoined but the judgments
which it predicted. Josiah’s righteousness could at
most ensure for himself a peaceful death: his people
were incorrigible and doomed.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The reforms indeed
proceeded, there was public and widespread penitence,
idolatry was abolished. But those were only shallow
pedants who put their trust in the possession of a
revealed Law and purged Temple,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and who boasted
that therefore Israel was secure. Jeremiah repeated the
gloomy forecasts of Zephaniah and Huldah, and even
before the wickedness of Jehoiakim’s reign proved the
obduracy of Israel’s heart, he affirmed <i>the imminence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the evil out of the north and the great destruction</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Of
our three prophets in this period Zephaniah, though the
earliest, had therefore the last word. While Nahum
and Habakkuk were almost wholly absorbed with the
epoch that is closing, he had a vision of the future. Is
this why his book has been ranged among our Twelve
after those of his slightly later contemporaries?</p>

<p>The precise course of events in Israel was this—and
we must follow them, for among them we have
to seek exact dates for Nahum and Habakkuk. In
621 the Book of the Law was discovered, and Josiah
applied himself with thoroughness to the reforms which
he had already begun. For thirteen years he seems
to have had peace to carry them through. The
heathen altars were thrown down, with all the high
places in Judah and even some in Samaria. Images
were abolished. The heathen priests were exterminated,
with the wizards and soothsayers. The
Levites, except the sons of Zadok, who alone were
allowed to minister in the Temple, henceforth the only
place of sacrifice, were debarred from priestly duties.
A great passover was celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The king did
justice and was the friend of the poor;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> it went well
with him and the people.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He extended his influence
into Samaria; it is probable that he ventured to carry
out the injunctions of Deuteronomy with regard to the
neighbouring heathen.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Literature flourished: though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>critics have not combined upon the works to be
assigned to this reign, they agree that a great many
were produced in it. Wealth must have accumulated:
certainly the nation entered the troubles of the next
reign with an arrogant confidence that argues under
Josiah the rapid growth of prosperity in every direction.
Then of a sudden came the fatal year of 608. Pharaoh
Necho appeared in Palestine<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> with an army destined
for the Euphrates, and Josiah went up to meet him
at Megiddo. His tactics are plain—it is the first
strait on the land-road from Egypt to the Euphrates—but
his motives are obscure. Assyria can hardly
have been strong enough at this time to fling him as
her vassal across the path of her ancient foe. He
must have gone of himself. “His dream was probably
to bring back the scattered remains of the
northern kingdom to a pure worship, and to unite the
whole people of Israel under the sceptre of the house
of David; and he was not inclined to allow Egypt to
cross his aspirations, and rob him of the inheritance
which was falling to him from the dead hand of
Assyria.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Josiah fell, and with him not only the liberty of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
people, but the chief support of their faith. That
the righteous king was cut down in the midst of his
days and in defence of the Holy Land—what could
this mean? Was it, then, vain to serve the Lord?
Could He not defend His own? With some the
disaster was a cause of sore complaint, and with
others, perhaps, of open desertion from Jehovah.</p>

<p>But the extraordinary thing is, how little effect
Josiah’s death seems to have had upon the people’s
self-confidence at large, or upon their adherence to
Jehovah. They immediately placed Josiah’s second
son on the throne; but Necho, having got him by some
means to his camp at Riblah between the Lebanons,
sent him in fetters to Egypt, where he died, and
established in his place Eliakim, his elder brother. On
his accession Eliakim changed his name to Jehoiakim,
a proof that Jehovah was still regarded as the sufficient
patron of Israel; and the same blind belief that, for
the sake of His Temple and of His Law, Jehovah
would keep His people in security, continued to persevere
in spite of Megiddo. It was a most immoral
ease, and filled with injustice. Necho subjected the
land to a fine. This was not heavy, but Jehoiakim,
instead of paying it out of the royal treasures, exacted
it from <i>the people of the land</i>,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and then employed the
peace which it purchased in erecting a costly palace
for himself by the forced labour of his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
He was covetous, unjust and violently cruel. Like
prince like people: social oppression prevailed, and
there was a recrudescence of the idolatries of Manasseh’s
time,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> especially (it may be inferred) after Necho’s
defeat at Carchemish in 605. That all this should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>exist along with a fanatic trust in Jehovah need not
surprise us who remember the very similar state of the
public mind in North Israel under Amos and Hosea.
Jeremiah attacked it as they had done. Though
Assyria was fallen, and Egypt was promising protection,
Jeremiah predicted destruction from the north on Egypt
and Israel alike. When at last the Egyptian defeat at
Carchemish stirred some vague fears in the people’s
hearts, Jeremiah’s conviction broke out into clear flame.
For three-and-twenty years he had brought God’s word
in vain to his countrymen. Now God Himself would
act: Nebuchadrezzar was but His servant to lead
Israel into captivity.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The same year, 605 or 604, Jeremiah wrote all these
things in a volume;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and a few months later, at a
national fast, occasioned perhaps by the fear of the
Chaldeans, Baruch, his secretary, read them in the
house of the Lord, in the ears of all the people.
The king was informed, the roll was brought to him,
and as it was read, with his own hands he cut it up and
burned it, three or four columns at a time. Jeremiah
answered by calling down on Jehoiakim an ignominious
death, and repeated the doom already uttered on the
land. Another prophet, Urijah, had recently been
executed for the same truth; but Jeremiah and Baruch
escaped into hiding.</p>

<p>This was probably in 603, and for a little time
Jehoiakim and the populace were restored to their false
security by the delay of the Chaldeans to come south.
Nebuchadrezzar was occupied in Babylon, securing
his succession to his father. At last, either in 602 or
more probably in 600, he marched into Syria, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Jehoiakim <i>became his servant for three years</i>.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In such
a condition the Jewish state might have survived for at
least another generation,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but in 599 or 597 Jehoiakim,
with the madness of the doomed, held back his tribute.
The revolt was probably instigated by Egypt, which,
however, did not dare to support it. As in Isaiah’s
time against Assyria, so now against Babylon, Egypt
was a blusterer <i>who blustered and sat still</i>. She still
<i>helped in vain and to no purpose</i>.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Nor could Judah
count on the help of the other states of Palestine.
They had joined Hezekiah against Sennacherib, but
remembering perhaps how Manasseh had failed to help
them against Assurbanipal, and that Josiah had carried
things with a high hand towards them,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> they obeyed
Nebuchadrezzar’s command and raided Judah till he
himself should have time to arrive.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Amid these raids
the senseless Jehoiakim seems to have perished,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> for
when Nebuchadrezzar appeared before Jerusalem in
597, his son Jehoiachin, a youth of eighteen, had
succeeded to the throne. The innocent reaped the
harvest sown by the guilty. In the attempt (it would
appear) to save his people from destruction,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Jehoiachin
capitulated. But Nebuchadrezzar was not content with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the person of the king: he deported to Babylon the
court, a large number of influential persons, <i>the mighty
men of the land</i> or what must have been nearly all the
fighting men, with the necessary military artificers and
swordsmiths. Priests also went, Ezekiel among them,
and probably representatives of other classes not
mentioned by the annalist. All these were the flower
of the nation. Over what was left Nebuchadrezzar
placed a son of Josiah on the throne who took the
name of Zedekiah. Again with a little common-sense,
the state might have survived; but it was a short
respite. The new court began intrigues with Egypt,
and Zedekiah, with the Ammonites and Tyre, ventured
a revolt in 589. Jeremiah and Ezekiel knew it was
in vain. Nebuchadrezzar marched on Jerusalem, and
though for a time he had to raise the siege in order to
defeat a force sent by Pharaoh Hophra, the Chaldean
armies closed in again upon the doomed city. Her
defence was stubborn; but famine and pestilence
sapped it, and numbers fell away to the enemy. About
the eighteenth month, the besiegers took the northern
suburb and stormed the middle gate. Zedekiah and the
army broke their lines only to be captured at Jericho.
In a few weeks more the city was taken and given
over to fire. Zedekiah was blinded, and with a large
number of his people carried to Babylon. It was the
end, for although a small community of Jews was left
at Mizpeh under a Jewish viceroy and with Jeremiah
to guide them, they were soon broken up and fled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Egypt. Judah had perished. Her savage neighbours,
who had gathered with glee to the day of Jerusalem’s
calamity, assisted the Chaldeans in capturing the
fugitives, and Edomites came up from the south on
the desolate land.</p>

<p class="thb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been necessary to follow so far the course of
events, because of our prophets Zephaniah is placed
in each of the three sections of Josiah’s reign, and by
some even in Jehoiakim’s; Nahum has been assigned to
different points between the eve of the first and the eve
of the second siege of Niniveh; and Habakkuk has
been placed by different critics in almost every year
from 621 to the reign of Jehoiachin; while Obadiah,
whom we shall find reasons for dating during the Exile,
describes the behaviour of Edom at the final siege of
Jerusalem. The next of the Twelve, Haggai, may have
been born before the Exile, but did not prophesy till
520. Zechariah appeared the same year, Malachi not
for half a century after. These three are prophets of
the Persian period. With the approach of the Greeks
Joel appears, then comes the prophecy which we find
in the end of Zechariah’s book, and last of all the Book
of Jonah. To all these post-exilic prophets we shall
provide later on the necessary historical introductions.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF ZEPHANIAH</p>

<p class="noindent">
The Book of Zephaniah is one of the most difficult
in the prophetic canon. The title is very generally
accepted; the period from which chap. i. dates is
recognised by practically all critics to be the reign of
Josiah, or at least the last third of the seventh century.
But after that doubts start, and we find present nearly
every other problem of introduction.</p>

<p>To begin with, the text is very damaged. In some
passages we may be quite sure that we have not the
true text;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> in others we cannot be sure that we have
it,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and there are several glosses.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>The bulk of the
second chapter was written in the Qinah, or elegiac
measure, but as it now stands the rhythm is very
much broken. It is difficult to say whether this is due
to the dilapidation of the original text or to wilful
insertion of glosses and other later passages. The
Greek version of Zephaniah possesses the same general
features as that of other difficult prophets. Occasionally
it enables us to correct the text; but by the time
it was made the text must already have contained
the same corruptions which we encounter, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>translators were ignorant besides of the meaning of
some phrases which to us are plain.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The difficulties of textual criticism as well as of
translation are aggravated by the large number of words,
grammatical forms and phrases which either happen
very seldom in the Old Testament,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> or nowhere else
in it at all.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Of the rare words and phrases, a very
few (as will be seen from the appended notes) are
found in earlier writings. Indeed all that are found
are from the authentic prophecies of Isaiah, with whose
style and doctrine Zephaniah’s own exhibit most
affinity. All the other rarities of vocabulary and
grammar are shared only by <i>later</i> writers; and as a
whole the language of Zephaniah exhibits symptoms
which separate it by many years from the language
of the prophets of the eighth century, and range it
with that of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the Second Isaiah
and still later literature. It may be useful to the
student to collect in a note the most striking of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
symptoms of the comparative lateness of Zephaniah’s
dialect.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>We now come to the question of date, and we take,
to begin with, the First Chapter. It was said above that
critics agree as to the general period—between 639,
when Josiah began to reign, and 600. But this period
was divided into three very different sections, and each
of these has received considerable support from modern
criticism. The great majority of critics place the
chapter in the early years of Josiah, before the enforcement
of Deuteronomy and the great Reform in 621.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Others have argued for the later years of Josiah,
621—608, on the ground that the chapter implies that
the great Reform has already taken place, and otherwise
shows knowledge of Deuteronomy;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> while some
prefer the days of reaction under Jehoiakim, 608 ff.,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and assume that the phrase in the title, <i>in the days of
Josiah</i>, is a late and erroneous inference from i. 4.</p>

<p>The evidence for the argument consists of the title
and the condition of Judah reflected in the body of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>chapter. The latter is a definite piece of oratory.
Under the alarm of an immediate and general war,
Zephaniah proclaims a vast destruction upon the earth.
Judah must fall beneath it: the worshippers of Baal,
of the host of heaven and of Milcom, the apostates
from Jehovah, the princes and house of the king, the
imitators of foreign fashions, and the forceful and
fraudulent, shall be cut off in a great slaughter. Those
who have grown sceptical and indifferent to Jehovah
shall be unsettled by invasion and war. This shall
be the Day of Jehovah, near and immediate, a day of
battle and disaster on the whole land.</p>

<p>The conditions reflected are thus twofold—the idolatrous
and sceptical state of the people, and an impending
invasion. But these suit, more or less exactly, each
of the three sections of our period. For Jeremiah
distinctly states that he had to attack idolatry in Judah
for twenty-three years, 627 to 604;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> he inveighs against
the falseness and impurity of the people alike before
the great Reform, and after it while Josiah was still
alive, and still more fiercely under Jehoiakim. And,
while before 621 the great Scythian invasion was
sweeping upon Palestine from the north, after 621,
and especially after 604, the Babylonians from the same
quarter were visibly threatening the land. But when
looked at more closely, the chapter shows several
features which suit the second section of our period less
than they do the other two. The worship of the host of
heaven, probably introduced under Manasseh, was put
down by Josiah in 621; it revived under Jehoiakim,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
but during the latter years of Josiah it cannot
possibly have been so public as Zephaniah describes.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Other reasons which have been given for those years
are inconclusive<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>—the chapter, for instance, makes no
indubitable reference to Deuteronomy or the Covenant
of 621—and on the whole we may leave the end of
Josiah’s reign out of account. Turning to the third
section, Jehoiakim’s reign, we find one feature of the
prophecy which suits it admirably. The temper described
in ver.&nbsp;12—<i>men who are settled on their lees,
who say in their heart, Jehovah doeth neither good nor
evil</i>—is the kind of temper likely to have been produced
among the less earnest adherents of Jehovah by the
failure of the great Reform in 621 to effect either the
purity or the prosperity of the nation. But this is
more than counterbalanced by the significant exception
of the king from the condemnation which ver.&nbsp;8 passes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>on the <i>princes and the sons of the king</i>. Such an exception
could not have been made when Jehoiakim was
on the throne; it points almost conclusively to the
reign of the good Josiah. And with this agrees the
title of the chapter—<i>in the days of Josiah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> We are,
therefore, driven back to the years of Josiah before
621. In these we find no discrepancy either with the
chapter itself, or with its title. The southward march
of the Scythians,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> between 630 and 625, accounts for
Zephaniah’s alarm of a general war, including the
invasion of Judah; the idolatrous practices which he
describes may well have been those surviving from
the days of Manasseh,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and not yet reached by the
drastic measures of 621; the temper of scepticism and
hopelessness condemned by ver.&nbsp;12 was possible among
those adherents of Jehovah who had hoped greater
things from the overthrow of Amon than the slow and
small reforms of the first fifteen years of Josiah’s reign.
Nor is a date before 621 made at all difficult by
the genealogy of Zephaniah in the title. If, as is
probable,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the Hezekiah given as his great-great-grandfather
be Hezekiah the king, and if he died
about 695, and Manasseh, his successor, who was then
twelve, was his eldest son, then by 630 Zephaniah
cannot have been much more than twenty years of age,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>and not more than twenty-five by the time the Scythian
invasion had passed away.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It is therefore by no
means impossible to suppose that he prophesied before
625; and besides, the data of the genealogy in the
title are too precarious to make them valid, as against
an inference from the contents of the chapter itself.</p>

<p>The date, therefore, of the first chapter of Zephaniah
may be given as about 625 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
and probably rather
before than after that year, as the tide of Scythian
invasion has apparently not yet ebbed.</p>

<p>The other two chapters have within recent years been
almost wholly denied to Zephaniah. Kuenen doubted
chap. iii. 9–20. Stade makes all chap. iii. post-exilic,
and suspects ii. 1–3, 11. A very thorough examination
of them has led Schwally<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> to assign to exilic or post-exilic
times the whole of the little sections comprising
them, with the possible exception of chap. iii. 1–7, which
“may be” Zephaniah’s. His essay has been subjected
to a searching and generally hostile criticism by a
number of leading scholars;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and he has admitted the
inconclusiveness of some of his reasons.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Chap. ii. 1–4 is assigned by Schwally to a date later
than Zephaniah’s, principally because of the term <i>meekness</i>
(ver.&nbsp;3), which is a favourite one with post-exilic
writers. He has been sufficiently answered;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
close connection of vv. 1–3 with chap. i. has been clearly
proved.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Chap. ii. 4–15 is the passage in elegiac
measure but broken, an argument for the theory that
insertions have been made in it. The subject is a
series of foreign nations—Philistia (5–7), Moab and
Ammon (8–10), Egypt (11) and Assyria (13–15). The
passage has given rise to many doubts; every one must
admit the difficulty of coming to a conclusion as to its
authenticity. On the one hand, the destruction just
predicted is so universal that, as Professor Davidson
says, we should expect Zephaniah to mention other
nations than Judah.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The concluding oracle on Niniveh
must have been published before 608, and even Schwally
admits that it may be Zephaniah’s own. But if this be
so, then we may infer that the first of the oracles on
Philistia is also Zephaniah’s, for both it and the oracle
on Assyria are in the elegiac measure, a fact which
makes it probable that the whole passage, however
broken and intruded upon, was originally a unity. Nor
is there anything in the oracle on Philistia incompatible
with Zephaniah’s date. Philistia lay on the path of
the Scythian invasion; the phrase in ver.&nbsp;7, <i>shall turn
their captivity</i>, is not necessarily exilic. As Cornill, too,
points out, the expression in ver.&nbsp;13, <i>He will stretch out
His hand to the north</i>, implies that the prophecy has
already looked in other directions. There remains the
passage between the oracles on Philistia and Assyria.
This is not in the elegiac measure. Its subject is Moab
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>and Ammon, who were not on the line of the Scythian
invasion, and Wellhausen further objects to it, because
the attitude to Israel of the two peoples whom it
describes is that which is attributed to them only just
before the Exile and surprises us in Josiah’s reign.
Dr. Davidson meets this objection by pointing out that,
just as in Deuteronomy, so here, Moab and Ammon
are denounced, while Edom, which in Deuteronomy is
spoken of with kindness, is here not denounced at all.
A stronger objection to the passage is that ver.&nbsp;11
predicts the conversion of the nations, while ver.&nbsp;12
makes them the prey of Jehovah’s sword, and in this
ver.&nbsp;12 follows on naturally to ver.&nbsp;7. On this ground
as well as on the absence of the elegiac measure the
oracle on Moab and Ammon is strongly to be suspected.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the most probable conclusion is
that chap. ii. 4–15 was originally an authentic oracle of
Zephaniah’s in the elegiac metre, uttered at the same
date as chap. i.—ii. 3, the period of the Scythian
invasion, though from a different standpoint; and
that it has suffered considerable dilapidation (witness
especially vv. 6 and 14), and probably one great
intrusion, vv. 8–10.</p>

<p>There remains the Third Chapter. The authenticity
has been denied by Schwally, who transfers the whole
till after the Exile. But the chapter is not a unity.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
In the first place, it falls into two sections, vv. 1–13 and
14–20. There is no reason to take away the bulk of
the first section from Zephaniah. As Schwally admits,
the argument here is parallel to that of chap. i.—ii. 3. It
could hardly have been applied to Jerusalem during or
after the Exile, but suits her conditions before her fall.
Schwally’s linguistic objections to a pre-exilic date have
been answered by Budde.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He holds ver.&nbsp;6 to be out
of place and puts it after ver.&nbsp;8, and this may be. But as
it stands it appeals to the impenitent Jews of ver.&nbsp;5 with
the picture of the judgment God has already completed
upon the nations, and contrasts with ver.&nbsp;7, in which
God says that He trusts Israel will repent. Vv. 9 and
10 are, we shall see, obviously an intrusion, as Budde
maintains and Davidson admits to be possible.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>We reach more certainty when we come to the
second section of the chapter, vv. 14–20. Since
Kuenen it has been recognised by the majority of critics
that we have here a prophecy from the end of the Exile
or after the Return. The temper has changed. Instead
of the austere and sombre outlook of chap.
i.—ii. 3 and chap. iii. 1–13, in which the sinful Israel
is to be saved indeed, but only as by fire, we have
a triumphant prophecy of her recovery from all affliction
(nothing is said of her sin) and of her glory among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the nations of the world. To put it otherwise, while
the genuine prophecies of Zephaniah almost grudgingly
allow a door of escape to a few righteous and humble
Israelites from a judgment which is to fall alike on
Israel and the Gentiles, chap. iii. 14–20 predicts Israel’s
deliverance from her Gentile oppressors, her return
from captivity and the establishment of her renown
over the earth. The language, too, has many resemblances
to that of Second Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Obviously therefore
we have here, added to the severe prophecies of
Zephaniah, such a more hopeful, peaceful epilogue as
we saw was added, during the Exile or immediately
after it, to the despairing prophecies of Amos.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE PROPHET AND THE REFORMERS</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">EPHANIAH</span> i.—ii. 3</p>

<p class="noindent">
Towards the year 625, when King Josiah had
passed out of his minority,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and was making
his first efforts at religious reform, prophecy, long
slumbering, awoke again in Israel.</p>

<p>Like the king himself, its first heralds were men in
their early youth. In 627 Jeremiah calls himself but
a boy, and Zephaniah can hardly have been out of
his teens.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> For the sudden outbreak of these young
lives there must have been a large reservoir of patience
and hope gathered in the generation behind them.
So Scripture itself testifies. To Jeremiah it was said:
<i>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before
thou camest forth out of the womb I consecrated thee.</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
In an age when names were bestowed only because of
their significance,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> both prophets bore that of Jehovah
in their own. So did Jeremiah’s father, who was of
the priests of Anathoth. Zephaniah’s “forbears” are
given for four generations, and with one exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
they also are called after Jehovah: <i>The Word of
Jehovah which came to Ṣephanyah, son of Kushi, son of
Gedhalyah, son of Amaryah, son of Hizḳiyah, in the
days of Joshiyahu,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Amon’s son, king of Judah.</i>
Zephaniah’s great-great-grandfather Hezekiah was in
all probability the king.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> His father’s name Kushi,
or <i>Ethiop</i>, is curious. If we are right, that Zephaniah
was a young man towards 625, then Kushi must have
been born towards 663, about the time of the conflicts
between Assyria and Egypt, and it is possible that, as
Manasseh and the predominant party in Judah so
closely hung upon and imitated Assyria, the adherents
of Jehovah put their hope in Egypt, whereof, it may be,
this name Kushi is a token.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The name Zephaniah
itself, meaning <i>Jehovah hath hidden</i>, suggests the
prophet’s birth in the “killing-time” of Manasseh.
There was at least one other contemporary of the
same name—a priest executed by Nebuchadrezzar.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the adherents of Jehovah, then, and probably
of royal descent, Zephaniah lived in Jerusalem. We
descry him against her, almost as clearly as we
descry Isaiah. In the glare and smoke of the conflagration
which his vision sweeps across the world,
only her features stand out definite and particular:
the flat roofs with men and women bowing in the
twilight to the host of heaven, the crowds of priests,
the nobles and their foreign fashions; the <i>Fishgate</i>, the
New or <i>Second</i> Town, where the rich lived, the <i>Heights</i>
to which building had at last spread, and between
them the hollow <i>Mortar</i>, with its markets, Phœnician
merchants and money-dealers. In the first few verses
of Zephaniah we see almost as much of Jerusalem as
in the whole book either of Isaiah or Jeremiah.</p>

<p>For so young a man the vision of Zephaniah may seem
strangely dark and final. Yet not otherwise was Isaiah’s
inaugural vision, and as a rule it is the young and not
the old whose indignation is ardent and unsparing.
Zephaniah carries this temper to the extreme. There
is no great hope in his book, hardly any tenderness
and never a glimpse of beauty. A townsman, Zephaniah
has no eye for nature; not only is no fair prospect
described by him, he has not even a single metaphor
drawn from nature’s loveliness or peace. He is
pitilessly true to his great keynotes: <i>I will sweep,
sweep from the face of the ground; He will burn</i>, burn
up everything. No hotter book lies in all the Old
Testament. Neither dew nor grass nor tree nor any
blossom lives in it, but it is everywhere fire, smoke
and darkness, drifting chaff, ruins, nettles, saltpits, and
owls and ravens looking from the windows of desolate
palaces. Nor does Zephaniah foretell the restoration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of nature in the end of the days. There is no prospect
of a redeemed and fruitful land, but only of a group
of battered and hardly saved characters: a few meek
and righteous are hidden from the fire and creep forth
when it is over. Israel is left <i>a poor and humble folk</i>.
No prophet is more true to the doctrine of the remnant,
or more resolutely refuses to modify it. Perhaps he
died young.</p>

<p>The full truth, however, is that Zephaniah, though
he found his material in the events of his own day, tears
himself loose from history altogether. To the earlier
prophets the Day of the Lord, the crisis of the world,
is a definite point in history: full of terrible, divine
events, yet “natural” ones—battle, siege, famine,
massacre and captivity. After it history is still to flow
on, common days come back and Israel pursue their
way as a nation. But to Zephaniah the Day of the
Lord begins to assume what we call the “supernatural.”
The grim colours are still woven of war and siege, but
mixed with vague and solemn terrors from another
sphere, by which history appears to be swallowed
up, and it is only with an effort that the prophet
thinks of a rally of Israel beyond. In short, with
Zephaniah the Day of the Lord tends to become the
Last Day. His book is the first tinging of prophecy with
apocalypse: that is the moment which it supplies in
the history of Israel’s religion. And, therefore, it was
with a true instinct that the great Christian singer of
the Last Day took from Zephaniah his keynote. The
“Dies Iræ, Dies Illa” of Thomas of Celano is but the
Vulgate translation of Zephaniah’s <i>A day of wrath is
that day</i>.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, though the first of apocalyptic writers,
Zephaniah does not allow himself the license of apocalypse.
As he refuses to imagine great glory for the
righteous, so he does not dwell on the terrors of the
wicked. He is sober and restrained, a matter-of-fact
man, yet with power of imagination, who, amidst the
vague horrors he summons, delights in giving a sharp
realistic impression. The Day of the Lord, he says,
what is it? <i>A strong man—there!—crying bitterly.</i><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>It is to the fierce ardour, and to the elemental interests
of the book, that we owe the absence of two features
of prophecy which are so constant in the prophets of
the eighth century. Firstly, Zephaniah betrays no
interest in the practical reforms which (if we are right
about the date) the young king, his contemporary, had
already started.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> There was a party of reform, the
party had a programme, the programme was drawn
from the main principles of prophecy and was designed
to put these into practice. And Zephaniah was a
prophet—and ignored them. This forms the dramatic
interest of his book. Here was a man of the same faith
which kings, priests and statesmen were striving to
realise in public life, in the assured hope—as is plain
from the temper of Deuteronomy—that the nation as
a whole would be reformed and become a very great
nation, righteous and victorious. All this he ignored,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and gave his own vision of the future: Israel is a
brand plucked from the burning; a very few meek
and righteous are saved from the conflagration of a
whole world. Why? Because for Zephaniah the
elements were loose, and when the elements were
loose what was the use of talking about reforms?
The Scythians were sweeping down upon Palestine,
with enough of God’s wrath in them to destroy a people
still so full of idolatry as Israel was; and if not the
Scythians, then some other power in that dark, rumbling
North which had ever been so full of doom. Let
Josiah try to reform Israel, but it was neither Josiah’s
nor Israel’s day that was falling. It was the Day of
the Lord, and when He came it was neither to reform
nor to build up Israel, but to make visitation and to
punish in His wrath for the unbelief and wickedness
of which the nation was still full.</p>

<p>An analogy to this dramatic opposition between
prophet and reformer may be found in our own century.
At its crisis, in 1848, there were many righteous men
rich in hope and energy. The political institutions of
Europe were being rebuilt. In our own land there
were great measures for the relief of labouring children
and women, the organisation of labour and the just
distribution of wealth. But Carlyle that year held
apart from them all, and, though a personal friend of
many of the reformers, counted their work hopeless:
society was too corrupt, the rudest forces were loose,
“Niagara” was near. Carlyle was proved wrong and
the reformers right, but in the analogous situation
of Israel the reformers were wrong and the prophet
right. Josiah’s hope and daring were overthrown at
Megiddo, and, though the Scythians passed away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Zephaniah’s conviction of the sin and doom of Israel
was fulfilled, not forty years later, in the fall of
Jerusalem and the great Exile.</p>

<p>Again, to the same elemental interests, as we may
call them, is due the absence from Zephaniah’s pages
of all the social and individual studies which form the
charm of other prophets. With one exception, there
is no analysis of character, no portrait, no satire. But
the exception is worth dwelling upon: it describes the
temper equally abhorred by both prophet and reformer—that
of the indifferent and stagnant man. Here we
have a subtle and memorable picture of character, which
is not without its warnings for our own time.</p>

<p>Zephaniah heard God say: <i>And it shall be at that
time that I will search out Jerusalem with lights, and I
will make visitation upon the men who are become
stagnant upon their lees, who say in their hearts, Jehovah
doeth no good and doeth no evil.</i><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The metaphor is
clear. New wine was left upon its lees only long
enough to fix its colour and body.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> If not then drawn
off it grew thick and syrupy—sweeter indeed than the
strained wine, and to the taste of some more pleasant,
but feeble and ready to decay. “To settle upon one’s
lees” became a proverb for sloth, indifference and the
muddy mind. <i>Moab hath been at ease from his youth
and hath settled upon his lees, and hath not been emptied
from vessel to vessel; therefore his taste stands in him and
his scent is not changed.</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The characters stigmatised
by Zephaniah are also obvious. They were a precipitate
from the ferment of fifteen years back. Through
the cruel days of Manasseh and Amon hope had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>stirred and strained, emptied from vessel to vessel, and
so had sprung sparkling and keen into the new days of
Josiah. But no miracle came, only ten years of waiting
for the king’s majority and five more of small, tentative
reforms. Nothing divine happened. There were but
the ambiguous successes of a small party who had
secured the king for their principles. The court was
still full of foreign fashions, and idolatry was rank upon
the housetops. Of course disappointment ensued—disappointment
and listlessness. The new security
of life became a temptation; persecution ceased, and
religious men lived again at ease. So numbers of
eager and sparkling souls, who had been in the front
of the movement, fell away into a selfish and idle
obscurity. The prophet hears God say, <i>I must search
Jerusalem with lights</i> in order to find them. They had
“fallen from the van and the freemen”; they had “sunk
to the rear and the slaves,” where they wallowed in the
excuse that <i>Jehovah</i> Himself <i>would do nothing—neither
good</i>, therefore it is useless to attempt reform like
Josiah and his party, <i>nor evil</i>, therefore Zephaniah’s
prophecy of destruction is also vain. Exactly the
same temper was encountered by Mazzini in the second
stage of his career. Many of those, who with him had
eagerly dreamt of a free Italy, fell away when the first
revolt failed—fell away not merely into weariness and
fear, but, as he emphasises, into the very two tempers
which are described by Zephaniah, scepticism and
self-indulgence.</p>

<p>All this starts questions for ourselves. Here is
evidently the same public temper, which at all periods
provokes alike the despair of the reformer and the
indignation of the prophet: the criminal apathy of the
well-to-do classes sunk in ease and religious indifference.
We have to-day the same mass of obscure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
nameless persons, who oppose their almost unconquerable
inertia to every movement of reform, and are the
drag upon all vital and progressive religion. The
great causes of God and Humanity are not defeated
by the hot assaults of the Devil but by the slow,
crushing, glacier-like mass of thousands and thousands
of indifferent nobodies. God’s causes are never destroyed
by being blown up, but by being sat upon. It
is not the violent and anarchical whom we have to fear
in the war for human progress, but the slow, the staid,
the respectable. And the danger of these does not lie
in their stupidity. Notwithstanding all their religious
profession, it lies in their real scepticism. Respectability
may be the precipitate of unbelief. Nay, it is
that, however religious its mask, wherever it is mere
comfort, decorousness and conventionality; where,
though it would abhor articulately confessing that God
does nothing, it virtually means so—<i>says</i> so (as
Zephaniah puts it) <i>in its heart</i>, by refusing to share
manifest opportunities of serving Him, and covers its
sloth and its fear by sneering that God is not with
the great crusades for freedom and purity to which
it is summoned. In these ways, Respectability is the
precipitate which unbelief naturally forms in the selfish
ease and stillness of so much of our middle-class life.
And that is what makes mere respectability so
dangerous. Like the unshaken, unstrained wine to
which the prophet compares its obscure and muddy
comfort, it tends to decay. To some extent our
respectable classes are just the dregs and lees of our
national life; like all dregs, they are subject to corruption.
A great sermon could be preached on the
putrescence of respectability—how the ignoble comfort
of our respectable classes and their indifference to holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
causes lead to sensuality, and poison the very institutions
of the Home and the Family, on which they pride
themselves. A large amount of the licentiousness of
the present day is not that of outlaw and disordered
lives, but is bred from the settled ease and indifference
of many of our middle-class families.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the chief part of the sin of the obscure
units, which form these great masses of indifference,
that they think they escape notice and cover their
individual responsibility. At all times many have
sought obscurity, not because they are humble, but
because they are slothful, cowardly or indifferent.
Obviously it is this temper which is met by the words,
<i>I will search out Jerusalem with lights</i>. None of us
shall escape because we have said, “I will go with
the crowd,” or “I am a common man and have no
right to thrust myself forward.” We shall be followed
and judged, each of us for his and her personal attitude
to the great movements of our time. These things
are not too high for us: they are <i>our</i> duty; and we
cannot escape our duty by slinking into the shadow.</p>

<p>For all this wickedness and indifference Zephaniah
sees prepared the Day of the Lord—near, hastening
and very terrible. It sweeps at first in vague desolation
and ruin of all things, but then takes the outlines
of a solemn slaughter-feast for which Jehovah
has consecrated the guests, the dim unnamed armies
from the north. Judah shall be invaded, and they
that are at ease, who say <i>Jehovah does nothing</i>, shall
be unsettled and routed. One vivid trait comes in like
a screech upon the hearts of a people unaccustomed
for years to war. <i>Hark, Jehovah’s Day!</i> cries the
prophet. <i>A strong man—there!—crying bitterly.</i> From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
this flash upon the concrete, he returns to a great vague
terror, in which earthly armies merge in heavenly;
battle, siege, storm and darkness are mingled, and
destruction is spread abroad upon the whole earth.
The first shades of Apocalypse are upon us.</p>

a qualification for the few meek and righteous. They
may be hidden on the day of the Lord’s anger; but
even for them escape is only a possibility. Note the
absence of all mention of the Divine mercy as the cause
of deliverance. Zephaniah has no gospel of that kind.
The conditions of escape are sternly ethical—meekness,
the doing of justice and righteousness. So austere is
our prophet.</p>

<p class="captitle">NINIVE DELENDA</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">EPHANIAH</span> ii. 4–15</p>

<p class="noindent">There now come a series of oracles on foreign
nations, connected with the previous prophecy
by the conjunction <i>for</i>, and detailing the worldwide
judgment which it had proclaimed. But though dated
from the same period as that prophecy, <i>circa</i> 626,
these oracles are best treated by themselves.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>These oracles originally formed one passage in the
well-known Qinah or elegiac measure; but this has
suffered sadly both by dilapidation and rebuilding.
How mangled the text is may be seen especially
from vv. 6 and 14, where the Greek gives us some
help in restoring it. The verses (8–11) upon Moab
and Ammon cannot be reduced to the metre which
both precedes and follows them. Probably, therefore,
they are a later addition: nor did Moab and
Ammon lie upon the way of the Scythians, who are
presumably the invaders pictured by the prophet.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The poem begins with Philistia and the sea-coast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>the very path of the Scythian raid.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Evidently the
latter is imminent, the Philistine cities are shortly to be
taken and the whole land reduced to grass. Across
the emptied strip the long hope of Israel springs sea-ward;
but—mark!—not yet with a vision of the isles
beyond. The prophet is satisfied with reaching the
edge of the Promised Land: <i>by the sea shall they feed</i><a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>

<p>There comes now an oracle upon Moab and Ammon
(vv. 8–11). As already said, it is not in the elegiac
measure which precedes and follows it, while other
features cast a doubt upon its authenticity. Like other
oracles on the same peoples, this denounces the loud-mouthed
arrogance of the sons of Moab and Ammon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><i>I have heard<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the reviling of Moab and the insults of
the sons of Ammon, who have reviled My people and
vaunted themselves upon their<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> border. Wherefore as
I live, saith Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Moab shall
become as Sodom, and Ammon’s sons as Gomorrah—the
possession<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> of nettles, and saltpits,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and a desolation for
ever; the remnant of My people shall spoil them, and
the rest of My nation possess them. This to them for
their arrogance, because they reviled, and vaunted themselves
against, the people of<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Jehovah of Hosts. Jehovah

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next oracle is a very short one (ver. 12) upon
Egypt, which after its long subjection to Ethiopic
dynasties is called, not Miṣraim, but Kush, or Ethiopia.
The verse follows on naturally to ver.&nbsp;7, but is not
reducible to the elegiac measure.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Also ye, O Kushites, are the slain of My sword.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></i></p>

against Assyria, the climax and front of heathendom
(vv. 13–15). It must have been written before 608:
there is no reason to doubt that it is Zephaniah’s.</p>

<p>The essence of these oracles is their clear confidence
in the fall of Niniveh. From 652, when Egypt revolted
from Assyria, and, Assurbanipal notwithstanding, began
to push northward, men must have felt, throughout
all Western Asia, that the great empire upon the
Tigris was beginning to totter. This feeling was
strengthened by the Scythian invasion, and after 625
it became a moral certainty that Niniveh would fall<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>—which
happened in 607—6. These are the feelings, 625
to 608, which Zephaniah’s oracles reflect. We can
hardly over-estimate what they meant. Not a man
was then alive who had ever known anything else
than the greatness and the glory of Assyria. It was
two hundred and thirty years since Israel first felt
the weight of her arms.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> It was more than a hundred
since her hosts had swept through Palestine,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and for
at least fifty her supremacy had been accepted by
Judah. Now the colossus began to totter. As she
had menaced, so she was menaced. The ruins with
which for nigh three centuries she had strewn Western
Asia—to these were to be reduced her own impregnable
and ancient glory. It was the close of an epoch.</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">EPHANIAH</span> iii.</p>

<p class="noindent">The third chapter of the Book of Zephaniah
consists<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> of two sections, of which only the first,
<span class="nobreak">vv. 1–13</span>, is a genuine work of the prophet; while
the second, vv. 14–20, is a later epilogue such as
we found added to the genuine prophecies of Amos.
It is written in the large hope and brilliant temper of
the Second Isaiah, saying no word of Judah’s sin or
judgment, but predicting her triumphant deliverance
out of all her afflictions.</p>

<p>In a second address to his City (vv. 1–13) Zephaniah
strikes the same notes as he did in his first.
He spares the king, but denounces the ruling and
teaching classes. Jerusalem’s princes are lions, her
judges wolves, her prophets braggarts, her priests
pervert the law, her wicked have no shame. He
repeats the proclamation of a universal doom. But the
time is perhaps later. Judah has disregarded the many
threats. She will not accept the Lord’s discipline;
and while in chap. i.—ii. 3 Zephaniah had said that the
meek and righteous might escape the doom, he now
emphatically affirms that all proud and impenitent men
shall be removed from Jerusalem, and a humble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>people be left to her, righteous and secure. There
is the same moral earnestness as before, the same
absence of all other elements of prophecy than the
ethical. Before we ask the reason and emphasise the
beauty of this austere gospel, let us see the exact
words of the address. There are the usual marks of
poetic diction in it—elliptic phrases, the frequent absence
of the definite article, archaic forms and an order of the
syntax different from that which obtains in prose.
But the measure is difficult to determine, and must be
printed as prose. The echo of the elegiac rhythm in
the opening is more apparent than real: it is not
sustained beyond the first verse. Verses 9 and 10
are relegated to a footnote, as very probably an
intrusion, and disturbance of the argument.</p>

<p><i>Woe, rebel and unclean, city of oppression!<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> She

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such is the simple and austere gospel of Zephaniah.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>It is
not to be overlooked amid the lavish and gorgeous
promises which other prophets have poured around
it, and by ourselves, too, it is needed in our often
unscrupulous enjoyment of the riches of grace that
are in Christ Jesus. A thorough purgation, the
removal of the wicked, the sparing of the honest and
the meek; insistence only upon the rudiments of
morality and religion; faith in its simplest form of trust
in a righteous God, and character in its basal elements
of meekness and truth,—these and these alone survive
the judgment. Why does Zephaniah never talk of
the Love of God, of the Divine Patience, of the Grace
that has spared and will spare wicked hearts if only
it can touch them to penitence? Why has he no call
to repent, no appeal to the wicked to turn from
the evil of their ways? We have already seen part
of the answer. Zephaniah stands too near to judgment
and the last things. Character is fixed, the
time for pleading is past; there remains only the
separation of bad men from good. It is the same
standpoint (at least ethically) as that of Christ’s visions
of the Judgment. Perhaps also an austere gospel was
required by the fashionable temper of the day. The
generation was loud and arrogant; it gilded the future
to excess, and knew no shame.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The true prophet
was forced to reticence; he must make his age feel
the desperate earnestness of life, and that salvation is
by fire. For the gorgeous future of its unsanctified
hopes he must give it this severe, almost mean, picture
of a poor and humble folk, hardly saved but at last at
peace.</p>

<p>The permanent value of such a message is proved
by the thirst which we feel even to-day for the clear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
cold water of its simple promises. Where a glaring
optimism prevails, and the future is preached with a
loud assurance, where many find their only religious
enthusiasm in the resurrection of mediæval ritual
or the singing of stirring and gorgeous hymns of
second-hand imagery, how needful to be recalled to
the earnestness and severity of life, to the simplicity
of the conditions of salvation, and to their ethical, not
emotional, character! Where sensationalism has so
invaded religion, how good to hear the sober insistence
upon God’s daily commonplaces—<i>morning by morning
He bringeth forth His judgment to light</i>—and to know
that the acceptance of discipline is what prevails with
Him. Where national reform is vaunted and the progress
of education, how well to go back to a prophet
who ignored all the great reforms of his day that he
might impress his people with the indispensableness
of humility and faith. Where Churches have such
large ambitions for themselves, how necessary to hear
that the future is destined for <i>a poor folk</i>, the meek
and the honest. Where men boast that their religion—Bible,
Creed or Church—has undertaken to save them,
<i>vaunting themselves on the Mount of My Holiness</i>, how
needful to hear salvation placed upon character and a
very simple trust in God.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, is any one in despair at the
darkness and cruelty of this life, let him hear how
Zephaniah proclaims that, though all else be fraud, <i>the
Lord is righteous in the midst</i> of us, <i>He doth not let
Himself fail</i>, that the resigned heart and the humble,
the just and the pure heart, is imperishable, and in the
end there is at least peace.</p>

<p>Zephaniah’s prophecy was fulfilled. The Day of the
Lord came, and the people met their judgment. The
Remnant survived—<i>a folk poor and humble</i>. To
them, in the new estate and temper of their life, came
a new song from God—perhaps it was nearly a hundred
years after Zephaniah had spoken—and they added it
to his prophecies. It came in with wonderful fitness, for
it was the song of the redeemed, whom he had foreseen,
and it tuned his book, severe and simple, to the full
harmony of prophecy, so that his book might take
a place in the great choir of Israel—the diapason of
that full salvation which no one man, but only the
experience of centuries, could achieve.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF NAHUM</p>

<p class="noindent">The Book of Nahum consists of a double title and
three odes. The title runs <i>Oracle of Niniveh:
Book of the Vision of Nahum the Elḳôshite</i>. The three
odes, eager and passionate pieces, are all of them apparently
vibrant to the impending fall of Assyria. The
first, chap. i. with the possible inclusion of chap. ii. 2,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
is general and theological, affirming God’s power of
vengeance and the certainty of the overthrow of His
enemies. The second, chap. ii. with the omission of
ver.&nbsp;2,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and the third, chap, iii., can hardly be disjoined;
they both present a vivid picture of the siege, the
storm and the spoiling of Niniveh.</p>

<p>The introductory questions, which title and contents
start, are in the main three: 1. The position of Elḳôsh,
to which the title assigns the prophet; 2. The
authenticity of chap. i.; 3. The date of chaps, ii., iii.:
to which siege of Niniveh do they refer?</p>

<h4 id="VIsec1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
               id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
1. T<span class="small">HE</span>
      P<span class="small">OSITION OF</span>
      E<span class="small">LḲÔSH</span>.</h4>

<p>The title calls Nahum the Elḳôshite—that is, native
or citizen of Elḳôsh.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Three positions have been
claimed for this place, which is not mentioned elsewhere
in the Bible.</p>

<p>The first we take is the modern Al-Ḳûsh, a town
still flourishing about twenty-four miles to the north
of the site of Niniveh,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> with “no fragments of antiquity”
about it, but possessing a “simple plaster box,” which
Jews, Christians and Mohammedans alike reverence
as the tomb of Nahum.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> There is no evidence that
Al-Ḳûsh, a name of Arabic form, is older than the
Arab period, while the tradition which locates the
tomb there is not found before the sixteenth century
of our era, but on the contrary Nahum’s grave was
pointed out to Benjamin of Tudela in 1165 at ‘Ain
Japhata, on the south of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The tradition that
the prophet lived and died at Al-Ḳûsh is therefore
due to the similarity of the name to that of Nahum’s
Elḳôsh, as well as to the fact that Niniveh was the
subject of his prophesying.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In his book there is
no trace of proof for the assertion that Nahum was
a descendant of the ten tribes exiled in 721 to the
region to the north of Al-Ḳûsh. He prophesies for
Judah alone. Nor does he show any more knowledge
of Niniveh than her ancient fame must have scattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to the limits of the world.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> We might as well argue
from chap. iii. 8–10 that Nahum had visited Thebes
of Egypt.</p>

<p>The second tradition of the position of Elḳôsh is
older. In his commentary on Nahum Jerome says
that in his day it still existed, a petty village of Galilee,
under the name of Helkesei,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> or Elkese, and apparently
with an established reputation as the town of Nahum.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
But the book itself bears no symptom of its author’s
connection with Galilee, and although it was quite
possible for a prophet of that period to have lived there,
it is not very probable.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>A third tradition places Elḳôsh in the south of Judah.
A Syriac version of the accounts of the prophets, which
are ascribed to Epiphanius,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> describes Nahum as “of
Elḳôsh beyond Bêt Gabrê, of the tribe of Simeon”;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>it may be noted that Cyril of Alexandria says<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> that
Elkese was a village in the country of the Jews. This
tradition is superior to the first in that there is no apparent
motive for its fabrication, and to the second in so
far as Judah was at the time of Nahum a much more
probable home for a prophet than Galilee; nor does
the book give any references except such as might be
made by a Judæan.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> No modern place-name, however,
can be suggested with any certainty as the echo of
Elḳôsh. Umm Lâḳis, which has been proved not to
be Lachish, contains the same radicals, and some six
and a quarter miles east from Beit-Jibrin at the upper
end of the Wady es Sur there is an ancient well with
the name Bir el Ḳûs.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

2. T<span class="small">HE</span>
     A<span class="small">UTHENTICITY OF</span>
     C<span class="small">HAP</span>. I.</h4>

<p>Till recently no one doubted that the three chapters
formed a unity. “Nahum’s prophecy,” said Kuenen
in 1889, “is a whole.” In 1891<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Cornill affirmed that
no questions of authenticity arose in regard to the
book; and in 1892 Wellhausen saw in chap. i. an
introduction leading “in no awkward way to the proper
subject of the prophecy.”</p>

<p>Meantime, however, Bickell,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> discovering what he
thought to be the remains of an alphabetic Psalm
in chap. i. 1–7, attempted to reconstruct throughout
chap. i.—ii. 3 twenty-two verses, each beginning with a
successive letter of the alphabet. And, following this,
Gunkel in 1893 produced a more full and plausible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
reconstruction of the same scheme.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> By radical emendations
of the text, by excision of what he believes to
be glosses and by altering the order of many of the
verses, Gunkel seeks to produce twenty-three distichs,
twenty of which begin with the successive letters of
the alphabet, two are wanting, while in the first three
letters of the twenty-third, [<span class="heb">שׁבי</span>], he finds very probable
the name of the author, Shobai or Shobi.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> He takes
this ode, therefore, to be an eschatological Psalm of
the later Judaism, which from its theological bearing
has been thought suitable as an introduction to
Nahum’s genuine prophecies.</p>

<p>The text of chap. i.—ii. 4 has been badly mauled and
is clamant for reconstruction of some kind. As it
lies, there are traces of an alphabetical arrangement
as far as the beginning of ver.&nbsp;9,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and so far Gunkel’s
changes are comparatively simple. Many of his emendations
are in themselves and apart from the alphabetic
scheme desirable. They get rid of difficulties and
improve the poetry of the passage.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> His reconstruction
is always clever and as a whole forms a wonderfully
spirited poem. But to have produced good or poetical
Hebrew is not conclusive proof of having recovered
the original, and there are obvious objections to the
process. Several of the proposed changes are unnatural
in themselves and unsupported by anything except the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
exigencies of the scheme; for example, 2<i>b</i> and 3<i>a</i> are
dismissed as a gloss only because, if they be retained, the
<i>Aleph</i> verse is two bars too long. The gloss, Gunkel
thinks, was introduced to mitigate the absoluteness of
the declaration that Jehovah is a God of wrath and
vengeance; but this is not obvious and would hardly
have been alleged apart from the needs of the alphabetic
scheme. In order to find a <i>Daleth</i>, it is quite arbitrary
to say that the first <span class="heb">אמלל</span> in 4<i>b</i>
is redundant in face
of the second, and that a word beginning with <i>Daleth</i>
originally filled its place, but was removed because it
was a rare or difficult word! The re-arrangement of
7 and 8<i>a</i> is very clever, and reads as if it were right; but
the next effort, to get a verse beginning with <i>Lamed</i>,
is of the kind by which anything might be proved.
These, however, are nothing to the difficulties which
vv. 9–14 and chap. ii. 1, 3, present to an alphabetic
scheme, or to the means which Gunkel takes to surmount
them. He has to re-arrange the order of the verses,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
and of the words within the verses. The distichs
beginning with <i>Nun</i> and <i>Ḳoph</i> are wanting, or at
least undecipherable. To provide one with initial <i>Resh</i>
the interjection has to be removed from the opening
of chap. ii. 1, and the verse made to begin with <span class="heb">רגלי</span> and
to run thus: <i>the feet of him that bringeth good news
on the mountains; behold him that publisheth peace</i>.
Other unlikely changes will be noticed when we come
to the translation. Here we may ask the question: if
the passage was originally alphabetic, that is, furnished
with so fixed and easily recognised a frame, why has
it so fallen to pieces? And again, if it has so fallen
to pieces, is it possible that it can be restored? The
many arbitrarinesses of Gunkel’s able essay would seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to imply that it is not. Dr. Davidson says: “Even if
it should be assumed that an alphabetical poem lurks
under chap. i., the attempt to restore it, just as in
Psalm x., can never be more than an academic exercise.”</p>

<p>Little is to be learned from the language. Wellhausen,
who makes no objection to the genuineness of
the passage, thinks that about ver.&nbsp;7 we begin to catch
the familiar dialect of the Psalms. Gunkel finds a
want of originality in the language, with many touches
that betray connection not only with the Psalms but
with late eschatological literature. But when we take
one by one the clauses of chap, i., we discover very few
parallels with the Psalms, which are not at the same
time parallels with Jeremiah’s or some earlier writings.
That the prophecy is vague, and with much of the air
of the later eschatology about it, is no reason for
removing it from an age in which we have already
seen prophecy beginning to show the same apocalyptic
temper.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Gunkel denies any reference in ver.&nbsp;9<i>b</i> to
the approaching fall of Niniveh, although that is seen
by Kuenen, Wellhausen, König and others, and he
omits ver.&nbsp;11<i>a</i>, in which most read an allusion to
Sennacherib.</p>

<p>Therefore, while it is possible that a later poem has
been prefixed to the genuine prophecies of Nahum,
and the first chapter supplies many provocations to
belief in such a theory, this has not been proved, and
the able essays of proof have much against them. The
question is open.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

     <span class="small">AND</span> III.</h4>

<p>We turn now to the date of the Book apart from this
prologue. It was written after a great overthrow of
the Egyptian Thebes<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and when the overthrow of
Niniveh was imminent. Now Thebes had been devastated
by Assurbanipal about 664 (we know of no later
overthrow), and Niniveh fell finally about 607. Nahum
flourished, then, somewhere between 664 and 607.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
Some critics, feeling in his description of the fall of
Thebes the force of a recent impression, have placed
his prophesying immediately after that, or about 660.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
But this is too far away from the fall of Niniveh. In 660
the power of Assyria was unthreatened. Nor is 652,
the year of the revolt of Babylon, Egypt and the
princes of Palestine, a more likely date.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> For although
in that year Assyrian supremacy ebbed from Egypt
never to return, Assurbanipal quickly reduced Elam,
Babylon and all Syria. Nahum, on the other hand,
represents the very centre of the empire as threatened.
The land of Assyria is apparently already invaded (iii. 13,
etc.). Niniveh, if not invested, must immediately be so,
and that by forces too great for resistance. Her mixed
populace already show signs of breaking up. Within,
as without, her doom is sealed. All this implies not
only the advance of an enormous force upon Niniveh,
but the reduction of her people to the last stage of
hopelessness. Now, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Assyria proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
was thrice overrun. The Scythians poured across her
about 626, but there is no proof that they threatened
Niniveh.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> A little after Assurbanipal’s death in 625,
the Medes under King Phraortes invaded Assyria, but
Phraortes was slain and his son Kyaxares called away
by an invasion of his own country. Herodotus says
that this was after he had defeated the Assyrians in a
battle and had begun the siege of Niniveh,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> but before
he had succeeded in reducing the city. After a time
he subdued or assimilated the Medes, and then investing
Niniveh once more, about 607, in two years he took
and destroyed her.</p>

<p>To which of these two sieges by Kyaxares are we
to assign the Book of Nahum? Hitzig, Kuenen,
Cornill and others incline to the first on the ground
that Nahum speaks of the yoke of Assyria as
still heavy on Judah, though about to be lifted.
They argue that by 608, when King Josiah had
already felt himself free enough to extend his reforms
into Northern Israel, and dared to dispute Necho’s
passage across Esdraelon, the Jews must have been
conscious that they had nothing more to fear from
Assyria, and Nahum could hardly have written as he
does in i. 13, <i>I will break his yoke from off thee and
burst thy bonds in sunder</i>.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But this is not conclusive,
for <i>first</i>, as we have seen, it is not certain that i. 13 is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
from Nahum himself, and <i>second</i>, if it be from himself,
he might as well have written it about 608 as about
625, for he speaks not from the feelings of any single
year, but with the impression upon him of the whole
epoch of Assyrian servitude then drawing to a close.
The eve of the later siege as a date for the book is, as
Davidson remarks,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> “well within the verge of possibility,”
and some critics prefer it because in their
opinion Nahum’s descriptions thereby acquire greater
reality and naturalness. But this is not convincing, for if
Kyaxares actually began the siege of Niniveh about 625,
Nahum’s sense of the imminence of her fall is perfectly
natural. Wellhausen indeed denies that earlier siege.
“Apart from Herodotus,” he says, “it would never have
occurred to anybody to doubt that Nahum’s prophecy
coincided with the fall of Niniveh.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> This is true, for
it is to Herodotus alone that we owe the tradition of
the earlier siege. But what if we believe Herodotus?
In that case, it is impossible to come to a decision as
between the two sieges. With our present scanty
knowledge of both, the prophecy of Nahum suits either
equally well.<a name="FNanchor_234_234"
id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately it is not necessary to come to a decision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Nahum, we cannot too often insist, expresses the
feelings neither of this nor of that decade in the reign
of Josiah, but the whole volume of hope, wrath and
just passion of vengeance which had been gathering for
more than a century and which at last broke into exultation
when it became certain that Niniveh was falling.
That suits the eve of either siege by Kyaxares. Till
we learn a little more about the first siege and how
far it proceeded towards a successful result, perhaps
we ought to prefer the second. And of course those
who feel that Nahum writes not in the future but
the present tense of the details of Niniveh’s overthrow,
must prefer the second.</p>

<p class="thb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>That the form as well as the spirit of the Book of
Nahum is poetical is proved by the familiar marks of
poetic measure—the unusual syntax, the frequent
absence of the article and particles, the presence of
elliptic forms and archaic and sonorous ones. In the
two chapters on the siege of Niniveh the lines are
short and quick, in harmony with the dashing action
they echo.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the text of chap. i. is very uncertain.
The subject of the other two chapters involves
the use of a number of technical and some foreign
terms, of the meaning of most of which we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> There are apparently some glosses; here
and there the text is obviously disordered. We get
the usual help, and find the usual faults, in the
Septuagint; they will be noticed in the course of the
translation.</p>

</div>

<p class="captitle">THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD</p>

<p class="csubtitle">N<span class="small">AHUM</span> i</p>

<p class="noindent">The prophet Nahum, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> arose probably
in Judah, if not about the same time as
Zephaniah and Jeremiah, then a few years later.
Whether he prophesied before or after the great
Reform of 621 we have no means of deciding. His
book does not reflect the inner history, character or
merits of his generation. His sole interest is the fate
of Niniveh. Zephaniah had also doomed the Assyrian
capital, yet he was much more concerned with Israel’s
unworthiness of the opportunity presented to them.
The yoke of Asshur, he saw, was to be broken, but
the same cloud which was bursting from the north
upon Niniveh must overwhelm the incorrigible people
of Jehovah. For this Nahum has no thought. His
heart, for all its bigness, holds room only for the
bitter memories, the baffled hopes, the unappeased
hatreds of a hundred years. And that is why we
need not be anxious to fix his date upon one or other
of the shifting phases of Israel’s history during that
last quarter of the seventh century. For he represents
no single movement of his fickle people’s progress, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the passion of the whole epoch then drawing to a
close. Nahum’s book is one great At Last!</p>

<p>And, therefore, while Nahum is a worse prophet
than Zephaniah, with less conscience and less insight,
he is a greater poet, pouring forth the exultation
of a people long enslaved, who see their tyrant ready
for destruction. His language is strong and brilliant;
his rhythm rumbles and rolls, leaps and flashes, like
the horsemen and chariots he describes. It is a great
pity the text is so corrupt. If the original lay before
us, and that full knowledge of the times which the
excavation of ancient Assyria may still yield to us, we
might judge Nahum to be an even greater poet than
we do.</p>

<p>We have seen that there are some reasons for doubting
whether he wrote the first chapter of the book,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
but no one questions its fitness as an introduction to
the exultation over Niniveh’s fall in chapters ii. and iii.
The chapter is theological, affirming those general
principles of Divine Providence, by which the overthrow
of the tyrant is certain and God’s own people are
assured of deliverance. Let us place ourselves among
the people, who for so long a time had been thwarted,
crushed and demoralised by the most brutal empire
which was ever suffered to roll its force across the
world, and we shall sympathise with the author, who
for the moment will feel nothing about his God, save
that He is a God of vengeance. Like the grief of a
bereaved man, the vengeance of an enslaved people has
hours sacred to itself. And this people had such a
God! Jehovah must punish the tyrant, else were He
untrue. He had been patient, and patient, as a verse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
seems to hint,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> just because He was omnipotent, but
in the end He must rise to judgment. He was God of
heaven and earth, and it is the old physical proofs of
His power, so often appealed to by the peoples of the
East, for they feel them as we cannot, which this hymn
calls up as Jehovah sweeps to the overthrow of the
oppressor. <i>Before such power of wrath who may
stand? What think ye of Jehovah?</i> The God who
works with such ruthless, absolute force in nature will
not relax in the fate He is preparing for Niniveh. <i>He
is one who maketh utter destruction</i>, not needing to raise
up His forces a second time, and as stubble before
fire so His foes go down before Him. No half-measures
are His, Whose are the storm, the drought
and the earthquake.</p>

<p>Such is the sheer religion of the Proem to the Book
of Nahum—thoroughly Oriental in its sense of God’s
method and resources of destruction; very Jewish,
and very natural to that age of Jewish history, in the
bursting of its long pent hopes of revenge. We of
the West might express these hopes differently. We
should not attribute so much personal passion to the
Avenger. With our keener sense of law, we should
emphasise the slowness of the process, and select for
its illustration the forces of decay rather than those of
sudden ruin. But we must remember the crashing
times in which the Jews lived. The world was breaking
up. The elements were loose, and all that God’s
own people could hope for was the bursting of their
yoke, with a little shelter in the day of trouble. The
elements were loose, but amidst the blind crash the
little people knew that Jehovah knew them.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE SIEGE AND FALL OF NINIVEH</p>

<p class="csubtitle">N<span class="small">AHUM</span> ii., iii</p>

<p class="noindent">The scene now changes from the presence and
awful arsenal of the Almighty to the historical
consummation of His vengeance. Nahum foresees the
siege of Niniveh. Probably the Medes have already
overrun Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The <i>Old Lion</i> has withdrawn to
his inner den, and is making his last stand. The
suburbs are full of the enemy, and the great walls
which made the inner city one vast fortress are invested.
Nahum describes the details of the assault. Let us
try, before we follow him through them, to form some
picture of Assyria and her capital at this time.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> the Assyrian Empire began
about 625 to shrink to the limits of Assyria proper, or
Upper Mesopotamia, within the Euphrates on the south-west,
the mountain-range of Kurdistan on the north-east,
the river Chabor on the north-west and the
Lesser Zab on the south-east.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> This is a territory of
nearly a hundred and fifty miles from north to south,
and rather more than two hundred and fifty from east
to west. To the south of it the Viceroy of Babylon,
Nabopolassar, held practically independent sway over
Lower Mesopotamia, if he did not command as well a
large part of the Upper Euphrates Valley. On the north
the Medes were urgent, holding at least the farther
ends of the passes through the Kurdish mountains, if
they had not already penetrated these to their southern
issues.</p>

<p>The kernel of the Assyrian territory was the triangle,
two of whose sides are represented by the Tigris
and the Greater Zab, the third by the foot of the
Kurdistan mountains. It is a fertile plain, with some
low hills. To-day the level parts of it are covered by
a large number of villages and well-cultivated fields.
The more frequent mounds of ruin attest in ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
times a still greater population. At the period of which
we are treating, the plains must have been covered by
an almost continuous series of towns. At either end lay
a group of fortresses. The southern was the ancient
capital of Assyria, Kalchu, now Nimrud, about six
miles to the north of the confluence of the Greater Zab
and the Tigris. The northern, close by the present
town of Khorsabad, was the great fortress and palace
of Sargon, Dur-Sargina:<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> it covered the roads upon
Niniveh from the north, and standing upon the upper
reaches of the Choser protected Niniveh’s water supply.
But besides these there were scattered upon all the
main roads and round the frontiers of the territory a
number of other forts, towers and posts, the ruins of
many of which are still considerable, but others have
perished without leaving any visible traces. The roads
thus protected drew in upon Niniveh from all directions.
The chief of those, along which the Medes and their
allies would advance from the east and north, crossed
the Greater Zab, or came down through the Kurdistan
mountains upon the citadel of Sargon. Two of them
were distant enough from the latter to relieve the
invaders from the necessity of taking it, and Kalchu
lay far to the south of all of them. The brunt of the
first defence of the land would therefore fall upon the
smaller fortresses.</p>

<p>Niniveh itself lay upon the Tigris between Kalchu
and Sargon’s city, just where the Tigris is met by the
Choser. Low hills descend from the north upon the
very site of the fortress, and then curve east and south,
bow-shaped, to draw west again upon the Tigris at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the south end of the city. To the east of the latter
they leave a level plain, some two and a half miles by
one and a half. These hills appear to have been
covered by several forts. The city itself was four-sided,
lying lengthwise to the Tigris and cut across its breadth
by the Choser. The circumference was about seven
and a half miles, enclosing the largest fortified space
in Western Asia, and capable of holding a population
of three hundred thousand. The western wall, rather
over two and a half miles long, touched the Tigris at
either end, but between there lay a broad, bow-shaped
stretch of land, probably in ancient times, as now, free
of buildings. The north-western wall ran up from the
Tigris for a mile and a quarter to the low ridge which
entered the city at its northern corner. From this the
eastern wall, with a curve upon it, ran down in face of
the eastern plain for a little more than three miles, and
was joined to the western by the short southern wall
of not quite half a mile. The ruins of the western wall
stand from ten to twenty, those of the others from
twenty-five to sixty, feet above the natural surface, with
here and there the still higher remains of towers.
There were several gates, of which the chief were one
in the northern and two in the eastern wall. Round
all the walls except the western ran moats about a
hundred and fifty feet broad—not close up to the foot
of the walls, but at a distance of some sixty feet.
Water was supplied by the Choser to all the moats
south of it; those to the north were fed from a canal
which entered the city near its northern corner. At
these and other points one can still trace the remains
of huge dams, batardeaux and sluices; and the moats
might be emptied by opening at either end of the
western wall other dams, which kept back the waters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
from the bed of the Tigris. Beyond its moat, the eastern
wall was protected north of the Choser by a large
outwork covering its gate, and south of the Choser by
another outwork, in shape the segment of a circle, and
consisting of a double line of fortification more than
five hundred yards long, of which the inner wall was
almost as high as the great wall itself, but the outer
considerably lower. Again, in front of this and in face
of the eastern plain was a third line of fortification,
consisting of a low inner wall and a colossal outer wall
still rising to a height of fifty feet, with a moat one
hundred and fifty feet broad between them. On the
south this third line was closed by a large fortress.</p>

<p>Upon the trebly fortified city the Medes drew in from east and north,
far away from Kalchu and able to avoid even Dur-Sargina. The other
fortresses on the frontier and the approaches fell into their hands,
says Nahum, like <i>ripe fruit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> He cries to Niniveh to prepare
for the siege.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Military authorities<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> suppose that the Medes
directed their main attack upon the northern corner of the city.
Here they would be upon a level with its highest point, and would
command the waterworks by which most of the moats were fed. Their
flank, too, would be protected by the ravines of the Choser. Nahum
describes fighting in the suburbs before the assault of the walls, and
it was just here, according to some authorities,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> that the famous
suburbs of Niniveh lay, out upon the canal and the road to Khorsabad.
All the open fighting which Nahum foresees would take place in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<i>outplaces</i> and <i>broad streets</i><a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>—the mustering of the
<i>red</i> ranks,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> the <i>prancing horses</i><a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and <i>rattling
chariots</i><a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and <i>cavalry at the charge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Beaten there
the Assyrians would retire to the great walls, and the waterworks
would fall into the hands of the besiegers. They would not immediately
destroy these,
but in order to bring their engines and battering-rams
against the walls they would have to lay strong dams across the moats;
the eastern moat has actually been found filled with rubbish in face of
a great breach at the north end of its wall. This breach may have been
effected not only by the rams but by directing upon the wall the waters
of the canal; or farther south the Choser itself, in its spring floods,
may have been confined by the besiegers and swept in upon the sluices
which regulate its passage through the eastern wall into the city. To
this means tradition has assigned the capture of Niniveh,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and
Nahum perhaps foresees the possibility of it: <i>the gates of the rivers

<p>Now of all this probable progress of the siege Nahum,
of course, does not give us a narrative, for he is writing
upon the eve of it, and probably, as we have seen, in
Judah, with only such knowledge of the position and
strength of Niniveh as her fame had scattered across
the world. The military details, the muster, the fighting
in the open, the investment, the assault, he did not
need to go to Assyria or to wait for the fall of Niniveh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to describe as he has done. Assyria herself (and
herein lies much of the pathos of the poem) had made
all Western Asia familiar with their horrors for the
last two centuries. As we learn from the prophets
and now still more from herself, Assyria was the great
Besieger of Men. It is siege, siege, siege, which Amos,
Hosea and Isaiah tell their people they shall feel: <i>siege
and blockade, and that right round the land!</i> It is siege,
irresistible and full of cruelty, which Assyria records
as her own glory. Miles of sculpture are covered
with masses of troops marching upon some Syrian or
Median fortress. Scaling ladders and enormous engines
are pushed forward to the walls under cover of a shower
of arrows. There are assaults and breaches, panic-stricken
and suppliant defenders. Streets and places
are strewn with corpses, men are impaled, women led
away weeping, children dashed against the stones. The
Jews had seen, had felt these horrors for a hundred
years, and it is out of their experience of them that
Nahum weaves his exultant predictions. The Besieger
of the world is at last besieged; every cruelty he has
inflicted upon men is now to be turned upon himself.
Again and again does Nahum return to the vivid details,—he
hears the very whips crack beneath the walls, and
the rattle of the leaping chariots; the end is slaughter,
dispersion and a dead waste.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>Two other points remain to be emphasised.</p>

<p>There is a striking absence from both chapters of any
reference to Israel.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Jehovah of Hosts is mentioned
twice in the same formula,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> but otherwise the author does
not obtrude his nationality. It is not in Judah’s name
he exults, but in that of all the peoples of Western Asia.
Niniveh has sold <i>peoples</i> by her harlotries and <i>races</i> by
her witchcraft; it is <i>peoples</i> that shall gaze upon her
nakedness and <i>kingdoms</i> upon her shame. Nahum
gives voice to no national passions, but to the outraged
conscience of mankind. We see here another proof, not
only of the large, human heart of prophecy, but of that
which in the introduction to these Twelve Prophets we
ventured to assign as one of its causes. By crushing
all peoples to a common level of despair, by the universal
pity which her cruelties excited, Assyria contributed to
the development in Israel of the idea of a common
humanity.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The other thing to be noticed is Nahum’s feeling of
the incoherence and mercenariness of the vast population
of Niniveh. Niniveh’s command of the world had
turned her into a great trading power. Under Assurbanipal
the lines of ancient commerce had been diverted
so as to pass through her. The immediate result was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
an enormous increase of population, such as the world
had never before seen within the limits of one city.
But this had come out of all races and was held
together only by the greed of gain. What had once
been a firm and vigorous nation of warriors, irresistible
in their united impact upon the world, was now a loose
aggregate of many peoples, without patriotism, discipline
or sense of honour. Nahum likens it to a reservoir of
waters,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> which as soon as it is breached must scatter,
and leave the city bare. The Second Isaiah said
the same of Babylon, to which the bulk of Niniveh’s
mercenary populace must have fled:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus are they grown to thee, they who did weary thee,<br /></div>
<div class="verse indent2">Traders of thine from thy youth up;<br /></div>
<div class="verse indent2">Each as he could escape have they fled;<br /></div>
<div class="verse indent4">None is thy helper.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a><br /></div>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The prophets saw the truth about both cities. Their
vastness and their splendour were artificial. Neither
of them, and Niniveh still less than Babylon, was a
natural centre for the world’s commerce. When their
political power fell, the great lines of trade, which had
been twisted to their feet, drew back to more natural
courses, and Niniveh in especial became deserted. This
is the explanation of the absolute collapse of that
mighty city. Nahum’s foresight, and the very metaphor
in which he expressed it, were thoroughly sound. The
population vanished like water. The site bears little
trace of any disturbance since the ruin by the Medes,
except such as has been inflicted by the weather
and the wandering tribes around. Mosul, Niniveh’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
representative to-day, is not built upon it, and is but
a provincial town. The district was never meant for
anything else.</p>

<p>The swift decay of these ancient empires from the
climax of their commercial glory is often employed as
a warning to ourselves. But the parallel, as the previous
paragraphs suggest, is very far from exact. If we
can lay aside for the moment the greatest difference
of all, in religion and morals, there remain others
almost of cardinal importance. Assyria and Babylonia
were not filled, like Great Britain, with reproductive
races, able to colonise distant lands, and carry everywhere
the spirit which had made them strong at home.
Still more, they did not continue at home to be homogeneous.
Their native forces were exhausted by long
and unceasing wars. Their populations, especially in
their capitals, were very largely alien and distraught,
with nothing to hold them together save their commercial
interests. They were bound to break up at
the first disaster. It is true that we are not without
some risks of their peril. No patriot among us can
observe without misgiving the large and growing proportion
of foreigners in that department of our life from
which the strength of our defence is largely drawn—our
merchant navy. But such a fact is very far from
bringing our empire and its chief cities into the fatal
condition of Niniveh and Babylon. Our capitals, our
commerce, our life as a whole are still British to
the core. If we only be true to our ideals of righteousness
and religion, if our patriotism continue moral
and sincere, we shall have the power to absorb the
foreign elements that throng to us in commerce, and
stamp them with our own spirit.</p>

<p>We are now ready to follow Nahum’s two great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
poems delivered on the eve of the Fall of Niniveh.
Probably, as we have said, the first of them has lost
its original opening. It wants some notice at the
outset of the object to which it is addressed: this is
indicated only by the second personal pronoun. Other
needful comments will be given in footnotes.</p>

</div>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF HABAKKUK</p>

<p class="noindent">As it has reached us, the Book of Habakkuk, under

the title <i>The Oracle which Habakkuk the prophet
received by vision</i>, consists of three chapters, which fall
into three sections. <i>First</i>: chap. i. 2—ii. 4 (or 8), a
piece in dramatic form; the prophet lifts his voice to
God against the wrong and violence of which his whole
horizon is full, and God sends him answer. <i>Second</i>:
chap. ii. 5 (or 9)-20, a taunt-song in a series of Woes
upon the wrong-doer. <i>Third</i>: chap. iii., part psalm,
part prayer, descriptive of a Theophany and expressive
of Israel’s faith in their God. Of these three sections
no one doubts the authenticity of the <i>first</i>; opinion is
divided about the <i>second</i>; about the <i>third</i> there is
a growing agreement that it is not a genuine work of
Habakkuk, but a poem from a period after the Exile.</p>

<h4 id="IXsec1">
1. C<span class="small">HAP</span>. I. 2—II. 4
(<span class="small">OR</span> 8).</h4>

<p>Yet it is the first piece which raises the most difficult
questions. All<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> admit that it is to be dated somewhere
along the line of Jeremiah’s long career, <i>c.</i> 627—586.
There is no doubt about the general trend of the
argument: it is a plaint to God on the sufferings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the righteous under tyranny, with God’s answer. But
the order and connection of the paragraphs of the
argument are not clear. There is also difference of
opinion as to who the tyrant is—native, Assyrian or
Chaldee; and this leads to a difference, of course,
about the date, which ranges from the early years of
Josiah to the end of Jehoiakim’s reign, or from about
630 to 597.</p>

<p>As the verses lie, their argument is this. In chap. i.
2–4 Habakkuk asks the Lord how long the wicked are
to oppress the righteous, to the paralysing of the Torah,
or Revelation of His Law, and the making futile of
judgment. For answer the Lord tells him, vv. 5–11,
to look round among the heathen: He is about to
raise up the Chaldees to do His work, a people
swift, self-reliant, irresistible. Upon which Habakkuk
resumes his question, vv. 12–17, how long will God
suffer a tyrant who sweeps up the peoples into his
net like fish? Is he to go on with this for ever? In
ii. 1 Habakkuk prepares for an answer, which comes in
ii. 2, 3, 4: let the prophet wait for the vision though
it tarries; the proud oppressor cannot last, but the
righteous shall live by his constancy, or faithfulness.</p>

<p>The difficulties are these. Who are the wicked
oppressors in chap. i. 2–4? Are they Jews, or some
heathen nation? And what is the connection between
vv. 1–4 and vv. 5–11? Are the Chaldees, who are
described in the latter, raised up to punish the tyrant
complained against in the former? To these questions
three different sets of answers have been given.</p>

<p><i>First</i>: the great majority of critics take the wrong
complained of in vv. 2–4 to be wrong done by unjust
and cruel Jews to their countrymen, that is, civic
disorder and violence, and believe that in vv. 5–11
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Jehovah is represented as raising up the Chaldees to
punish the sin of Judah—a message which is pretty much
the same as Jeremiah’s. But Habakkuk goes further:
the Chaldees themselves with their cruelties aggravate
his problem, how God can suffer wrong, and he appeals
again to God, vv. 12–17. Are the Chaldees to be allowed
to devastate for ever? The answer is given, as above,
in chap. ii. 1–4. Such is practically the view of Pusey,
Delitzsch, Kleinert, Kuenen, Sinker,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Driver, Orelli,
Kirkpatrick, Wildeboer and Davidson, a formidable
league, and Davidson says “this is the most natural
sense of the verses and of the words used in them.”
But these scholars differ as to the date. Pusey,
Delitzsch and Volck take the whole passage from i. 5
as prediction, and date it from before the rise of the
Chaldee power in 625, attributing the internal wrongs
of Judah described in vv. 2–4 to Manasseh’s reign or
the early years of Josiah.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> But the rest, on the
grounds that the prophet shows some experience of
the Chaldean methods of warfare, and that the account
of the internal disorder in Judah does not suit Josiah’s
reign, bring the passage down to the reign of Jehoiakim,
608—598, or of Jehoiachin, 597. Kleinert and Von
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Orelli date it before the battle of Carchemish, 506,
in which the Chaldean Nebuchadrezzar wrested from
Egypt the Empire of the Western Asia, on the ground
that after that Habakkuk could not have called a Chaldean
invasion of Judah incredible (i. 5). But Kuenen,
Driver, Kirkpatrick, Wildeboer and Davidson date it
after Carchemish. To Driver it must be immediately
after, and before Judah became alarmed at the consequences
to herself. To Davidson the description of the
Chaldeans “is scarcely conceivable before the battle,”
“hardly one would think before the deportation of the
people under Jehoiachin.”<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> This also is Kuenen’s
view, who thinks that Judah must have suffered at
least the first Chaldean raids, and he explains the use
of an undoubted future in chap. i. 5, <i>Lo, I am about to
raise up the Chaldeans</i>, as due to the prophet’s predilection
for a dramatic style. “He sets himself in the
past, and represents the already experienced chastisement
[of Judah] as having been then announced by
Jehovah. His contemporaries could not have mistaken
his meaning.”</p>

<p><i>Second</i>: others, however, deny that chap. i. 2–4 refers
to the internal disorder of Judah, except as the effect
of foreign tyranny. The <i>righteous</i> mentioned there
are Israel as a whole, <i>the wicked</i> their heathen oppressors.
So Hitzig, Ewald, König and practically Smend.
Ewald is so clear that Habakkuk ascribes no sin to
Judah, that he says we might be led by this to assign
the prophecy to the reign of the righteous Josiah; but
he prefers, because of the vivid sense which the prophet
betrays of actual experience of the Chaldees, to date the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
passage from the reign of Jehoiakim, and to explain
Habakkuk’s silence about his people’s sinfulness as due
to his overwhelming impression of Chaldean cruelty.
König<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> takes vv. 2–4 as a general complaint of the
violence that fills the prophet’s day, and vv. 5–11 as
a detailed description of the Chaldeans, the instruments
of this violence. Vv. 5–11, therefore, give not
the judgment upon the wrongs described in vv. 2–4,
but the explanation of them. Lebanon is already
wasted by the Chaldeans (ii. 17); therefore the whole
prophecy must be assigned to the days of Jehoiakim.
Giesebrecht<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and Wellhausen adhere to the view that
no sins of Judah are mentioned, but that the <i>righteous</i>
and <i>wicked</i> of chap. i. 4 are the same as in ver.&nbsp;13,
viz. Israel and a heathen tyrant. But this leads them
to dispute that the present order of the paragraphs of
the prophecy is the right one. In chap. i. 5 the
Chaldeans are represented as about to be raised up
for the first time, although their violence has already
been described in vv. 1–4, and in vv. 12–17 these are
already in full career. Moreover ver.&nbsp;12 follows on
naturally to ver.&nbsp;4. Accordingly these critics would
remove the section vv. 5–11. Giesebrecht prefixes it
to ver.&nbsp;1, and dates the whole passage from the Exile.
Wellhausen calls 5–11 an older passage than the rest
of the prophecy, and removes it altogether as not
Habakkuk’s. To the latter he assigns what remains,
i. 1–4, 12–17, ii. 1–5, and dates it from the reign of
Jehoiakim.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p><i>Third</i>: from each of these groups of critics Budde of
Strasburg borrows something, but so as to construct an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
arrangement of the verses, and to reach a date, for the
whole, from which both differ.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> With Hitzig, Ewald,
König, Smend, Giesebrecht and Wellhausen he agrees
that the violence complained of in i. 2–4 is that inflicted
by a heathen oppressor, <i>the wicked</i>, on the Jewish
nation, the <i>righteous</i>. But with Kuenen and others
he holds that the Chaldeans are raised up, according
to i. 5–11, to punish the violence complained of in i. 2–4
and again in i. 12–17. In these verses it is the
ravages of another heathen power than the Chaldeans
which Budde descries. The Chaldeans are still to
come, and cannot be the same as the devastator whose
long continued tyranny is described in i. 12–17. They
are rather the power which is to punish him. He can
only be the Assyrian. But if that be so, the proper
place for the passage, i. 5–11, which describes the rise
of the Chaldeans must be after the description of the
Assyrian ravages in i. 12–17, and in the body of God’s
answer to the prophet which we find in ii. 2 ff. Budde,
therefore, places i. 5–11 after ii. 2–4. But if the
Chaldeans are still to come, and Budde thinks that
they are described vaguely and with a good deal of
imagination, the prophecy thus arranged must fall
somewhere between 625, when Nabopolassar the
Chaldean made himself independent of Assyria and
King of Babylon, and 607, when Assyria fell. That
the prophet calls Judah <i>righteous</i> is proof that he wrote
after the great Reform of 621; hence, too, his reference
to Torah and Mishpat (i. 4), and his complaint of the
obstacles which Assyrian supremacy presented to their
free course. As the Assyrian yoke appears not to
have been felt anywhere in Judah by 608, Budde would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
fix the exact date of Habakkuk’s prophecy about 615.
To these conclusions of Budde Cornill, who in 1891
had very confidently assigned the prophecy of Habakkuk
to the reign of Jehoiakim, gave his adherence in 1896.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Budde’s very able and ingenious argument has been
subjected to a searching criticism by Professor Davidson,
who emphasises first the difficulty of accounting
for the transposition of chap. i. 5–11 from what Budde
alleges to have been its original place after ii. 4 to its
present position in chap. i.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> He points out that if
chap. i. 2–4 and 12–17 and ii. 5 ff. refer to the Assyrian,
it is strange the latter is not once mentioned. Again,
by 615 we may infer (though we know little of
Assyrian history at this time) that the Assyrian’s hold
on Judah was already too relaxed for the prophet to
impute to him power to hinder the Law, especially as
Josiah had begun to carry his reforms into the northern
kingdom; and the knowledge of the Chaldeans displayed
in i. 5–11 is too fresh and detailed<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> to suit so
early a date: it was possible only after the battle of
Carchemish. And again, it is improbable that we have
two different nations, as Budde thinks, described by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
very similar phrases in i. 11, <i>his own power becomes
his god</i>, and in i. 16, <i>he sacrifices to his net</i>. Again,
chap. i. 5–11 would not read quite naturally after
chap. ii. 4. And in the woes pronounced on the
oppressor it is not one nation, the Chaldeans, which
are to spoil him, but all the remnant of the peoples
(ii. 7, 8).</p>

<p>These objections are not inconsiderable. But are
they conclusive? And if not, is any of the other
theories of the prophecy less beset with difficulties?</p>

<p>The objections are scarcely conclusive. We have no
proof that the power of Assyria was altogether removed
from Judah by 615; on the contrary, even in 608
Assyria was still the power with which Egypt went
forth to contend for the empire of the world. Seven
years earlier her hand may well have been strong upon
Palestine. Again, by 615 the Chaldeans, a people
famous in Western Asia for a long time, had been ten
years independent: men in Palestine may have been
familiar with their methods of warfare; at least it is
impossible to say they were not.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> There is more
weight in the objection drawn from the absence of the
name of Assyria from all of the passages which Budde
alleges describe it; nor do we get over all difficulties
of text by inserting i. 5–11 between ii. 4 and 5. Besides,
how does Budde explain i. 12<i>b</i> on the theory that it
means Assyria? Is the clause not premature at that
point? Does he propose to elide it, like Wellhausen?
And in any case an erroneous transposition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
original is impossible to prove and difficult to account
for.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>But have not the other theories of the Book of
Habakkuk equally great difficulties? Surely, we cannot
say that the <i>righteous</i> and the <i>wicked</i> in i. 4 mean
something different from what they do in i. 13? But
if this is impossible the construction of the book
supported by the great majority of critics<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> falls to the
ground. Professor Davidson justly says that it has
“something artificial in it” and “puts a strain on the
natural sense.”<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> How can the Chaldeans be described
in i. 5 as <i>just about to be raised up</i>, and in 14–17 as
already for a long time the devastators of earth?
Ewald’s, Hitzig’s and König’s views<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> are equally beset
by these difficulties; König’s exposition also “strains
the natural sense.” Everything, in fact, points to i. 5–11
being out of its proper place; it is no wonder that
Giesebrecht, Wellhausen and Budde independently
arrived at this conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Whether Budde be right
in inserting i. 5–11 after ii. 4, there can be little doubt
of the correctness of his views that i. 12–17 describe
a heathen oppressor who is not the Chaldeans. Budde
says this oppressor is Assyria. Can he be any one
else? From 608 to 605 Judah was sorely beset by
Egypt, who had overrun all Syria up to the Euphrates.
The Egyptians killed Josiah, deposed his successor, and
put their own vassal under a very heavy tribute; <i>gold
and silver were exacted of the people of the land</i>: the
picture of distress in i. 1–4 might easily be that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Judah in these three terrible years. And if we assigned
the prophecy to them, we should certainly give it a
date at which the knowledge of the Chaldeans expressed
in i. 5–11 was more probable than at Budde’s
date of 615. But then does the description in chap,
i. 14–17 suit Egypt so well as it does Assyria? We
can hardly affirm this, until we know more of what
Egypt did in those days, but it is very probable.</p>

<p>Therefore, the theory supported by the majority
of critics being unnatural, we are, with our present
meagre knowledge of the time, flung back upon Budde’s
interpretation that the prophet in i. 2—ii. 4 appeals
from oppression by a heathen power, which is not the
Chaldean, but upon which the Chaldean shall bring
the just vengeance of God. The tyrant is either
Assyria up to about 615 or Egypt from 608 to 605,
and there is not a little to be said for the latter date.</p>

<p>In arriving at so uncertain a conclusion about i.—ii.
4, we have but these consolations, that no other is
possible in our present knowledge, and that the uncertainty
will not hamper us much in our appreciation
of Habakkuk’s spiritual attitude and poetic gifts.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<h4 id="IXsec2">2. C<span class="small">HAP</span>. II. 5–20.</h4>

<p>The dramatic piece i. 2—ii. 4 is succeeded by a series
of fine taunt-songs, starting after an introduction from
6<i>b</i>, then 9, 11, 15 and (18) 19, and each opening with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
<i>Woe!</i> Their subject is, if we take Budde’s interpretation
of the dramatic piece, the Assyrian and not the
Chaldean<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> tyrant. The text, as we shall see when we
come to it, is corrupt. Some words are manifestly
wrong, and the rhythm must have suffered beyond
restoration. In all probability these fine lyric Woes,
or at least as many of them as are authentic—for there
is doubt about one or two—were of equal length.
Whether they all originally had the refrain now
attached to two is more doubtful.</p>

<p>Hitzig suspected the authenticity of some parts of
this series of songs. Stade<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and Kuenen have gone
further and denied the genuineness of vv. 9–20. But
this is with little reason. As Budde says, a series
of Woes was to be expected here by a prophet who
follows so much the example of Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> In spite of
Kuenen’s objection, vv. 9–11 would not be strange
of the Chaldean, but they suit the Assyrian better.
Vv. 12–14 are doubtful: 12 recalls Micah iii. 10;
13 is a repetition of Jer. li. 58; 14 is a variant of
Isa. xi. 9. Very likely Jer. li. 58, a late passage, is
borrowed from this passage; yet the addition used
here, <i>Are not these things<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> from the Lord of Hosts?</i>
looks as if it noted a citation. Vv. 15–17 are very
suitable to the Assyrian; there is no reason to take
them from Habakkuk.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The final song, vv. 18 and 19,
has its Woe at the beginning of its second verse,
and closely resembles the language of later prophets.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Moreover the refrain forms a suitable close at the end
of ver.&nbsp;17. ver.&nbsp;20 is a quotation from Zephaniah,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
perhaps another sign of the composite character of the
end of this chapter. Some take it to have been inserted
as an introduction to the theophany in chap. iii.</p>

<p>Smend has drawn up a defence<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> of the whole passage,
ii. 9–20, which he deems not only to stand in a natural
relation to vv. 4–8, but to be indispensable to them.
That the passage quotes from other prophets, he holds
to be no proof against its authenticity. If we break off
with ver.&nbsp;8, he thinks that we must impute to Habakkuk
the opinion that the wrongs of the world are chiefly
avenged by human means—a conclusion which is not
to be expected after chap. i.—ii. 1 ff.</p>

<h4 id="IXsec3">3. C<span class="small">HAP</span>. III.</h4>

<p>The third chapter, an Ode or Rhapsody, is ascribed to
Habakkuk by its title. This, however, does not prove
its authenticity: the title is too like those assigned to
the Psalms in the period of the Second Temple.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> On
the contrary, the title itself, the occurrence of the
musical sign Selah in the contents, and the colophon
suggest for the chapter a liturgical origin after the
Exile.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> That this is more probable than the alternative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>opinion, that, being a genuine work of Habakkuk, the
chapter was afterwards arranged as a Psalm for public
worship, is confirmed by the fact that no other work of
the prophets has been treated in the same way. Nor
do the contents support the authorship by Habakkuk.
They reflect no definite historical situation like the preceding
chapters. The style and temper are different.
While in them the prophet speaks for himself, here it
is the nation or congregation of Israel that addresses
God. The language is not, as some have maintained,
late;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> but the designation of the people as <i>Thine anointed</i>,
a term which before the Exile was applied to the king,
undoubtedly points to a post-exilic date. The figures,
the theophany itself, are not necessarily archaic, but
are more probably moulded on archaic models. There
are many affinities with Psalms of a late date.</p>

<p>At the same time a number of critics<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> maintain the
genuineness of the chapter, and they have some grounds
for this. Habakkuk was, as we can see from chaps. i.
and ii., a real poet. There was no need why a man of
his temper should be bound down to reflecting only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his own day. If so practical a prophet as Hosea,
and one who has so closely identified himself with his
times, was wont to escape from them to a retrospect of
the dealings of God with Israel from of old, why should
not the same be natural for a prophet who was much
less practical and more literary and artistic? There
are also many phrases in the Psalm which may be interpreted
as reflecting the same situation as chaps. i., ii.
All this, however, only proves possibility.</p>

<p>The Psalm has been adapted in Psalm lxxvii. 17–20.</p>

<h4>F<span class="small">URTHER</span>
     N<span class="small">OTE ON</span>
     C<span class="small">HAP</span>. I.—II. 4.</h4>

<p>Since this chapter was in print Nowack’s <i>Die Kleinen Propheten</i>
in the “Handkommentar z. A. T.” has been published. He recognises
emphatically that the disputed passage about the Chaldeans,
chap. i. 5–11, is out of place where it lies (this against Kuenen and
the other authorities cited above, p. 117), and admits that it follows
on, with a natural connection, to chap. ii. 4, to which Budde proposes
to attach it. Nevertheless, for other reasons, which he does
not state, he regards Budde’s proposal as untenable; and reckons the
disputed passage to be by another hand than Habakkuk’s, and intruded
into the latter’s argument. Habakkuk’s argument he assigns
to after 605; perhaps 590. The tyrant complained against would
therefore be the Chaldean.—Driver in the 6th ed. of his <i>Introduction</i>
(1897) deems Budde’s argument “too ingenious,” and holds by the
older and most numerously supported argument (above, pp. 116 ff.).—On
a review of the case in the light of these two discussions, the
present writer holds to his opinion that Budde’s rearrangement, which
he has adopted, offers the fewest difficulties.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE PROPHET AS SCEPTIC</p>

<p class="csubtitle">H<span class="small">ABAKKUK</span> i.—ii. 4</p>

<p class="noindent">Of the prophet Habakkuk we know nothing that
is personal save his name—to our ears his somewhat
odd name. It is the intensive form of a root which
means to caress or embrace. More probably it was
given to him as a child, than afterwards assumed as a
symbol of his clinging to God.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Tradition says that Habakkuk was a priest, the son
of Joshua, of the tribe of Levi, but this is only an
inference from the late liturgical notes to the Psalm
which has been appended to his prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> All that
we know for certain is that he was a contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of Jeremiah, with a sensitiveness under wrong and
impulses to question God which remind us of Jeremiah;
but with a literary power which is quite his own. We
may emphasise the latter, even though we recognise
upon his writing the influence of Isaiah’s.</p>

<p>Habakkuk’s originality, however, is deeper than
style. He is the earliest who is known to us of a new
school of religion in Israel. He is called <i>prophet</i>,
but at first he does not adopt the attitude which is
characteristic of the prophets. His face is set in
an opposite direction to theirs. They address the
nation Israel, on behalf of God: he rather speaks
to God on behalf of Israel. Their task was Israel’s
sin, the proclamation of God’s doom and the offer
of His grace to their penitence. Habakkuk’s task
is God Himself, the effort to find out what He
means by permitting tyranny and wrong. They
attack the sins, he is the first to state the problems,
of life. To him the prophetic revelation, the Torah, is
complete: it has been codified in Deuteronomy and
enforced by Josiah. Habakkuk’s business is not to
add to it but to ask why it does not work. Why
does God suffer wrong to triumph, so that the Torah is
paralysed, and Mishpat, the prophetic <i>justice</i> or <i>judgment</i>,
comes to nought? The prophets travailed for
Israel’s character—to get the people to love justice till
justice prevailed among them: Habakkuk feels justice
cannot prevail in Israel, because of the great disorder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
which God permits to fill the world. It is true that
he arrives at a prophetic attitude, and before the end
authoritatively declares God’s will; but he begins by
searching for the latter, with an appreciation of the
great obscurity cast over it by the facts of life. He
complains to God, asks questions and expostulates.
This is the beginning of speculation in Israel. It
does not go far: it is satisfied with stating questions
<i>to</i> God; it does not, directly at least, state questions
<i>against</i> Him. But Habakkuk at least feels that revelation
is baffled by experience, that the facts of life
bewilder a man who believes in the God whom the
prophets have declared to Israel. As in Zephaniah
prophecy begins to exhibit traces of apocalypse, so in
Habakkuk we find it developing the first impulses of
speculation.</p>

<p>We have seen that the course of events which
troubles Habakkuk and renders the Torah ineffectual
is somewhat obscure. On one interpretation of these
two chapters, that which takes the present order of
their verses as the original, Habakkuk asks why God
is silent in face of the injustice which fills the whole
horizon (chap. i. 1–4), is told to look round among the
heathen and see how God is raising up the Chaldeans
(i. 5–11), presumably to punish this injustice (if it be
Israel’s own) or to overthrow it (if vv. 1–4 mean
that it is inflicted on Israel by a foreign power). But
the Chaldeans only aggravate the prophet’s problem;
they themselves are a wicked and oppressive people:
how can God suffer them? (i. 12–17). Then come the
prophet’s waiting for an answer (ii. 1) and the answer
itself (ii. 2 ff.). Another interpretation takes the
passage about the Chaldeans (i. 5–11) to be out of
place where it now lies, removes it to after chap. ii. 4
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
as a part of God’s answer to the prophet’s problem,
and leaves the remainder of chap. i. as the description
of the Assyrian oppression of Israel, baffling the Torah
and perplexing the prophet’s faith in a Holy and Just
God.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Of these two views the former is, we have
seen, somewhat artificial, and though the latter is by
no means proved, the arguments for it are sufficient
to justify us in re-arranging the verses chap. i.—ii. 4 in
accordance with its proposals.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The difficulty of deciding between the various arrangements
of the two chapters of Habakkuk does not,
fortunately, prevent us from appreciating his argument.
What he feels throughout (this is obvious, however
you arrange his verses) is the tyranny of a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
heathen power,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> be it Assyrian, Egyptian or Chaldean.
The prophet’s horizon is filled with wrong:<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Israel
thrown into disorder, revelation paralysed, justice perverted.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
But, like Nahum, Habakkuk feels not for
Israel alone. The Tyrant has outraged humanity.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> He
<i>sweeps peoples into his net</i>, and as soon as he empties
this, he fills it again <i>ceaselessly</i>, as if there were no just
God above. He exults in his vast cruelty, and has
success so unbroken that he worships the very means
of it. In itself such impiety is gross enough, but to
a heart that believes in God it is a problem of exquisite
pain. Habakkuk’s is the burden of the finest faith.
He illustrates the great commonplace of religious
doubt, that problems arise and become rigorous in
proportion to the purity and tenderness of a man’s
conception of God. It is not the coarsest but the finest
temperaments which are exposed to scepticism. Every
advance in assurance of God or in appreciation of
His character develops new perplexities in face of the
facts of experience, and faith becomes her own most
cruel troubler. Habakkuk’s questions are not due to
any cooling of the religious temper in Israel, but
are begotten of the very heat and ardour of prophecy
in its encounter with experience. His tremulousness,
for instance, is impossible without the high knowledge
of God’s purity and faithfulness, which older prophets
had achieved in Israel:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Art not Thou of old, O LORD, my God, my Holy One,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Purer of eyes than to behold evil,</div>
<div class="verse">And incapable of looking upon wrong?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">His despair is that which comes only from eager and
persevering habits of prayer:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How long, O LORD, have I called and Thou hearest not!</div>
<div class="verse">I cry to Thee of wrong and Thou givest no help!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">His questions, too, are bold with that sense of God’s
absolute power, which flashed so bright in Israel as to
blind men’s eyes to all secondary and intermediate
causes. <i>Thou</i>, he says,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thou hast made men like fishes of the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Like worms that have no ruler,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">boldly charging the Almighty, in almost the temper of
Job himself, with being the cause of the cruelty inflicted
by the unchecked tyrant upon the nations; <i>for shall
evil happen, and Jehovah not have done it</i>?<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Thus all
through we perceive that Habakkuk’s trouble springs
from the central founts of prophecy. This scepticism—if
we may venture to give the name to the first motions
in Israel’s mind of that temper which undoubtedly
became scepticism—this scepticism was the inevitable
heritage of prophecy: the stress and pain to which
prophecy was forced by its own strong convictions in
face of the facts of experience. Habakkuk, <i>the prophet</i>,
as he is called, stood in the direct line of his order,
but just because of that he was the father also of
Israel’s religious doubt.</p>

<p>But a discontent springing from sources so pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was surely the preparation of its own healing. In
a verse of exquisite beauty the prophet describes the
temper in which he trusted for an answer to all his
doubts:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">On my watch-tower will I stand,</div>
<div class="verse">And take up my post on the rampart;</div>
<div class="verse">I will watch to see what He says to me,</div>
<div class="verse">And what answer I get back to my plea.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This verse is not to be passed over, as if its metaphors
were merely of literary effect. They express
rather the moral temper in which the prophet carries
his doubt, or, to use New Testament language, <i>the good
conscience, which some having put away, concerning faith
have made shipwreck</i>. Nor is this temper patience only
and a certain elevation of mind, nor only a fixed
attention and sincere willingness to be answered.
Through the chosen words there breathes a noble
sense of responsibility. The prophet feels he has a
post to hold, a rampart to guard. He knows the
heritage of truth, won by the great minds of the past;
and in a world seething with disorder, he will take his
stand upon that and see what more his God will send
him. At the very least, he will not indolently drift,
but feel that he has a standpoint, however narrow, and
bravely hold it. Such has ever been the attitude of
the greatest sceptics—not only, let us repeat, earnestness
and sincerity, but the recognition of duty towards
the truth: the conviction that even the most tossed and
troubled minds have somewhere a ποῦ στῶ appointed of
God, and upon it interests human and divine to defend.
Without such a conscience, scepticism, however intellectually
gifted, will avail nothing. Men who drift
never discover, never grasp aught. They are only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
dazzled by shifting gleams of the truth, only fretted
and broken by experience.</p>

<p>Taking then his stand within the patient temper, but
especially upon the conscience of his great order, the
prophet waits for his answer and the healing of his
trouble. The answer comes to him in the promise of
<i>a Vision</i>, which, though it seem to linger, will not be
later than the time fixed by God. <i>A Vision</i> is something
realised, experienced—something that will be as actual
and present to the waiting prophet as the cruelty which
now fills his sight. Obviously some series of historical
events is meant, by which, in the course of time, the
unjust oppressor of the nations shall be overthrown
and the righteous vindicated. Upon the re-arrangement
of the text proposed by Budde,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> this series of events
is the rise of the Chaldeans, and it is an argument
in favour of his proposal that the promise of <i>a Vision</i>
requires some such historical picture to follow it as we
find in the description of the Chaldeans—chap. i. 5–11.
This, too, is explicitly introduced by terms of vision:
<i>See among the nations and look round.... Yea, behold
I am about to raise up the Kasdim.</i> But before this
Vision is given,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and for the uncertain interval of
waiting ere the facts come to pass, the Lord enforces
upon His watching servant the great moral principle
that arrogance and tyranny cannot, from the nature
of them, last, and that if the righteous be only patient
he will survive them:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lo, swollen, not level, is his soul within him;</div>
<div class="verse">But the righteous shall live by his faithfulness.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
We have already seen<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> that the text of the first line
of this couplet is uncertain. Yet the meaning is
obvious, partly in the words themselves, and partly
by their implied contrast with the second line. The
soul of the wicked is a radically morbid thing: <i>inflated</i>,
<i>swollen</i> (unless we should read <i>perverted</i>, which more
plainly means the same thing<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>), not <i>level</i>, not natural
and normal. In the nature of things it cannot endure.
<i>But the righteous shall live by his faithfulness.</i> This
word, wrongly translated <i>faith</i> by the Greek and
other versions, is concentrated by Paul in his repeated
quotation from the Greek<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> upon that single act of
faith by which the sinner secures forgiveness and
justification. With Habakkuk it is a wider term.
<i>’Emunah</i>,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> from a verb meaning originally to be firm,
is used in the Old Testament in the physical sense of
steadfastness. So it is applied to the arms of Moses
held up by Aaron and Hur over the battle with Amalek:
<i>they were steadiness till the going down of the sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> It
is also used of the faithful discharge of public office,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
and of fidelity as between man and wife.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It is
also faithful testimony,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> equity in judgment,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> truth in
speech,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> and sincerity or honest dealing.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Of course
it has faith in God as its secret—the verb from which
it is derived is the regular Hebrew term to believe—but
it is rather the temper which faith produces of
endurance, steadfastness, integrity. Let the righteous,
however baffled his faith be by experience, hold on in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
loyalty to God and duty, and he shall live. Though
St. Paul, as we have said, used the Greek rendering
of <i>faith</i> for the enforcement of trust in God’s mercy
through Jesus Christ as the secret of forgiveness and
life, it is rather to Habakkuk’s wider intention of
patience and fidelity that the author of the Epistle
to the Hebrews returns in his fuller quotation of the
verse: <i>For yet a little while and He that shall come
will come and will not tarry; now the just shall live by
faith, but if he draw back My soul shall have no pleasure
in him.</i><a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Such then is the tenor of the passage. In face of
experience that baffles faith, the duty of Israel is
patience in loyalty to God. In this the nascent
scepticism of Israel received its first great commandment,
and this it never forsook. Intellectual questions
arose, of which Habakkuk’s were but the faintest
foreboding—questions concerning not only the mission
and destiny of the nation, but the very foundation of
justice and the character of God Himself. Yet did no
sceptic, however bold and however provoked, forsake
his <i>faithfulness</i>. Even Job, when most audaciously
arraigning the God of his experience, turned from Him
to God as in his heart of hearts he believed He must
be, experience notwithstanding. Even the Preacher,
amid the aimless flux and drift which he finds in the
universe, holds to the conclusion of the whole matter
in a command, which better than any other defines the
contents of the <i>faithfulness</i> enforced by Habakkuk:
<i>Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the
whole of man.</i> It has been the same with the great mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the race. Repeatedly disappointed of their hopes,
and crushed for ages beneath an intolerable tyranny,
have they not exhibited the same heroic temper with
which their first great questioner was endowed? Endurance—this
above all others has been the quality
of Israel: <i>though He slay me, yet will I trust Him</i>.
And, therefore, as Paul’s adaptation, <i>The just shall live
by faith</i>, has become the motto of evangelical Christianity,
so we may say that Habakkuk’s original of it
has been the motto and the fame of Judaism: <i>The
righteous shall live by his faithfulness.</i></p>

<p class="csubtitle">H<span class="small">ABAKKUK</span> ii. 5–20</p>

<p class="noindent">In the style of his master Isaiah, Habakkuk follows
up his <i>Vision</i> with a series of lyrics on the same
subject: chap. ii. 5–20. They are taunt-songs, the most
of them beginning with <i>Woe unto</i>, addressed to the
heathen oppressor. Perhaps they were all at first of
equal length, and it has been suggested that the striking
refrain in which two of them close—</p>

<p>was once attached to each of the others as well. But
the text has been too much altered, besides suffering
several interpolations,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> to permit of its restoration,
and we can only reproduce these taunts as they now
run in the Hebrew text. There are several quotations
(not necessarily an argument against Habakkuk’s
authorship); but, as a whole, the expression is original,
and there are some lines of especial force and freshness.
Verses 5–6<i>a</i> are properly an introduction, the
first Woe commencing with 6<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The belief which inspires these songs is very simple.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Tyranny is intolerable. In the nature of things it
cannot endure, but works out its own penalties. By
oppressing so many nations, the tyrant is preparing
the instruments of his own destruction. As he treats
them, so in time shall they treat him. He is like a
debtor who increases the number of his creditors.
Some day they shall rise up and exact from him the
last penny. So that in cutting off others he is <i>but
forfeiting his own life</i>. The very violence done to
nature, the deforesting of Lebanon for instance, and
the vast hunting of wild beasts, shall recoil on him.
This line of thought is exceedingly interesting. We
have already seen in prophecy, and especially in Isaiah,
the beginnings of Hebrew Wisdom—the attempt to
uncover the moral processes of life and express a
philosophy of history. But hardly anywhere have we
found so complete an absence of all reference to the
direct interference of God Himself in the punishment
of the tyrant; for <i>the cup of Jehovah’s right hand</i> in
ver.&nbsp;16 is simply the survival of an ancient metaphor.
These <i>proverbs</i> or <i>taunt-songs</i>, in conformity with the
proverbs of the later Wisdom, dwell only upon the
inherent tendency to decay of all injustice. Tyranny,
they assert, and history ever since has affirmed their
truthfulness—tyranny is suicide.</p>

<p>The last of the taunt-songs, which treats of the
different subject of idolatry, is probably, as we have
seen, not from Habakkuk’s hand, but of a later date.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p class="captitle">“IN THE MIDST OF THE YEARS”</p>

<p class="csubtitle">H<span class="small">ABAKKUK</span> iii.</p>

<p class="noindent">We have seen the impossibility of deciding the
age of the ode which is attributed to Habakkuk
in the third chapter of his book.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> But this is only
one of the many problems raised by that brilliant
poem. Much of its text is corrupt, and the meaning
of many single words is uncertain. As in most
Hebrew poems of description, the tenses of the verbs
puzzle us; we cannot always determine whether the
poet is singing of that which is past or present or
future, and this difficulty is increased by his subject,
a revelation of God in nature for the deliverance of
Israel. Is this the deliverance from Egypt, with the
terrible tempests which accompanied it? Or have the
features of the Exodus been borrowed to describe
some other deliverance, or to sum up the constant
manifestation of Jehovah for His people’s help?</p>

<p>The introduction, in ver.&nbsp;2, is clear. The singer
has heard what is to be heard of Jehovah, and His
great deeds in the past. He prays for a revival of
these <i>in the midst of the years</i>. The times are full of
trouble and turmoil. Would that God, in the present
confusion of baffled hopes and broken issues, made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Himself manifest by power and brilliance, as of old!
<i>In turmoil remember mercy!</i> To render <i>turmoil</i> by
<i>wrath</i>, as if it were God’s anger against which the
singer’s heart appealed, is not true to the original word
itself,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> affords no parallel to <i>the midst of the years</i>, and
misses the situation. Israel cries from a state of life
in which the obscure years are huddled together and
full of turmoil. We need not wish to fix the date
more precisely than the writer himself does, but may
leave it with him <i>in the midst of the years</i>.</p>

<p>There follows the description of the Great Theophany,
of which, in his own poor times, the singer has heard.
It is probable that he has in his memory the events
of the Exodus and Sinai. On this point his few
geographical allusions agree with his descriptions of
nature. He draws all the latter from the desert, or
Arabian, side of Israel’s history. He introduces none
of the sea-monsters, or imputations of arrogance and
rebellion to the sea itself, which the influence of
Babylonian mythology so thickly scattered through
the later sea-poetry of the Hebrews. The Theophany
takes place in a violent tempest of thunder and rain,
the only process of nature upon which the desert
poets of Arabia dwell with any detail. In harmony
with this, God appears from the southern desert, from
Teman and Paran, as in the theophanies in Deuteronomy
xxxiii. and in the Song of Deborah;<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
lines recall the Song of the Exodus,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and there are
many resemblances to the phraseology of the Sixty-Eighth
Psalm. The poet sees under trouble the tents
of Kushan and of Midian, tribes of Sinai. And though
the Theophany is with floods of rain and lightning,
and foaming of great waters, it is not with hills, rivers
or sea that God is angry, but with the <i>nations</i>, the
oppressors of His poor people, and in order that He
may deliver the latter. All this, taken with the fact
that no mention is made of Egypt, proves that, while
the singer draws chiefly upon the marvellous events
of the Exodus and Sinai for his description, he celebrates
not them alone but all the ancient triumphs
of God over the heathen oppressors of Israel. Compare
the obscure line—these be <i>His goings of old</i>.</p>

<p>The report of it all fills the poet with trembling
(ver.&nbsp;16 returns upon ver.&nbsp;26), and although his
language is too obscure to permit us to follow with
certainty the course of his feeling, he appears to await
in confidence the issue of Israel’s present troubles.
His argument seems to be, that such a God may be
trusted still, in face of approaching invasion (ver.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The next verse, however, does not express the experience
of trouble from human foes; but figuring
the extreme affliction of drought, barrenness and
poverty, the poet speaking in the name of Israel
declares that, in spite of them, he will still rejoice in
the God of their salvation (ver.&nbsp;17). So sudden is
this change from human foes to natural plagues, that
some scholars have here felt a passage to another
poem describing a different situation. But the last
lines with their confidence in the <i>God of salvation</i>, a
term always used of deliverance from enemies, and
the boast, borrowed from the Eighteenth Psalm, <i>He
maketh my feet like to hinds’ feet, and gives me to march
on my heights</i>, reflect the same circumstances as the
bulk of the Psalm, and offer no grounds to doubt the
unity of the whole.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>This Psalm, whose musical signs prove it to have
been employed in the liturgy of the Jewish Temple,
has also largely entered into the use of the Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Church. The vivid style, the sweep of vision, the
exultation in the extreme of adversity with which it
closes, have made it a frequent theme of preachers and
of poets. St. Augustine’s exposition of the Septuagint
version spiritualises almost every clause into a description
of the first and second advents of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
Calvin’s more sober and accurate learning interpreted
it of God’s guidance of Israel from the time
of the Egyptian plagues to the days of Joshua and
Gideon, and made it enforce the lesson that He who
so wonderfully delivered His people in their youth
will not forsake them in the midway of their career.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
The closing verses have been torn from the rest to
form the essence of a large number of hymns in many
languages.</p>

<p>For ourselves it is perhaps most useful to fasten
upon the poet’s description of his own position in the
midst of the years, and like him to take heart, amid
our very similar circumstances, from the glorious story
of God’s ancient revelation, in the faith that He is still
the same in might and in purpose of grace to His people.
We, too, live among the nameless years. We feel them
about us, undistinguished by the manifest workings of
God, slow and petty, or, at the most, full of inarticulate
turmoil. At this very moment we suffer from the
frustration of a great cause, on which believing men
had set their hearts as God’s cause; Christendom has
received from the infidel no greater reverse since the
days of the Crusades. Or, lifting our eyes to a larger
horizon, we are tempted to see about us a wide,
flat waste of years. It is nearly nineteen centuries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
since the great revelation of God in Christ, the redemption
of mankind, and all the wonders of the Early
Church. We are far, far away from that, and unstirred
by the expectation of any crisis in the near future.
We stand <i>in the midst of the years</i>, equally distant from
beginning and from end. It is the situation which
Jesus Himself likened to the long double watch in the
middle of the night—<i>if he come in the second watch
or in the third watch</i>—against whose dulness He
warned His disciples. How much need is there at
such a time to recall, like this poet, what God has done—how
often He has shaken the world and overturned
the nations, for the sake of His people and the Divine
causes they represent. <i>His ways are everlasting.</i> As
He then worked, so He will work now for the same
ends of redemption. Our prayer for <i>a revival of His
work</i> will be answered before it is spoken.</p>

<p>It is probable that much of our sense of the staleness
of the years comes from their prosperity. The dull
feeling that time is mere routine is fastened upon our
hearts by nothing more firmly than by the constant
round of fruitful seasons—that fortification of comfort,
that regularity of material supplies, which modern life
assures to so many. Adversity would brace us to a
new expectation of the near and strong action of our
God. This is perhaps the meaning of the sudden
mention of natural plagues in the seventeenth verse
of our Psalm. Not in spite of the extremes of misfortune,
but just because of them, should we exult in
<i>the God of our salvation</i>; and realise that it is by
discipline He makes His Church to feel that she is not
marching over the dreary levels of nameless years, but
<i>on our high places He makes us to march</i>.</p>

<p>“Grant, Almighty God, as the dulness and hardness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of our flesh is so great that it is needful for us to be
in various ways afflicted—oh grant that we patiently
bear Thy chastisement, and under a deep feeling of
sorrow flee to Thy mercy displayed to us in Christ, so
that we depend not on the earthly blessings of this
perishable life, but relying on Thy word go forward
in the course of our calling, until at length we be
gathered to that blessed rest which is laid up for us
in heaven, through Christ our Lord. Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF OBADIAH</p>

<p class="noindent">The Book of Obadiah is the smallest among the
prophets, and the smallest in all the Old Testament.
Yet there is none which better illustrates many
of the main problems of Old Testament criticism. It
raises, indeed, no doctrinal issue nor any question
of historical accuracy. All that it claims to be is
<i>The Vision of Obadiah</i>;<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and this vague name, with no
date or dwelling-place to challenge comparison with
the contents of the book, introduces us without prejudice
to the criticism of the latter. Nor is the book
involved in the central controversy of Old Testament
scholarship, the date of the Law. It has no reference
to the Law. Nor is it made use of in the New Testament.
The more freely, therefore, may we study
the literary and historical questions started by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
twenty-one verses which compose the book. Their
brief course is broken by differences of style, and by
sudden changes of outlook from the past to the future.
Some of them present a close parallel to another
passage of prophecy, a feature which when present
offers a difficult problem to the critic. Hardly any
of the historical allusions are free from ambiguity,
for although the book refers throughout to a single
nation—and so vividly that even if Edom were not
named we might still discern the character and crimes
of that bitter brother of Israel—yet the conflict of
Israel and Edom was so prolonged and so monotonous
in its cruelties, that there are few of its many centuries
to which some scholar has not felt himself able to
assign, in part or whole, Obadiah’s indignant oration.
The little book has been tossed out of one century into
another by successive critics, till there exists in their
estimates of its date a difference of nearly six hundred
years.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Such a fact seems, at first sight, to convict
criticism either of arbitrariness or helplessness;<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> yet a
little consideration of details is enough to lead us to
an appreciation of the reasonable methods of Old
Testament criticism, and of its indubitable progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
towards certainty, in spite of our ignorance of large
stretches of the history of Israel. To the student of the
Old Testament nothing could be more profitable than
to master the historical and literary questions raised
by the Book of Obadiah, before following them out
among the more complicated problems which are
started by other prophetical books in their relation to
the Law of Israel, or to their own titles, or to claims
made for them in the New Testament.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Book of Obadiah contains a number of verbal
parallels to another prophecy against Edom which
appears in Jeremiah xlix. 7–22. Most critics have
regarded this prophecy of Jeremiah as genuine, and
have assigned it to the year 604 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The question
is whether Obadiah or Jeremiah is the earlier.
Hitzig and Vatke<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> answered in favour of Jeremiah;
and as the Book of Obadiah also contains a description
of Edom’s conduct in the day of Jerusalem’s overthrow
by Nebuchadrezzar, in 586, they brought the
whole book down to post-exilic times. Very forcible
arguments, however, have been offered for Obadiah’s
priority.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Upon this priority, as well as on the
facts that Joel, whom they take to be early, quotes
from Obadiah, and that Obadiah’s book occurs among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the first six—presumably the pre-exilic members—of
the Twelve, a number of scholars have assigned all
of it to an early period in Israel’s history. Some
fix upon the reign of Jehoshaphat, when Judah was
invaded by Edom and his allies Moab and Ammon,
but saved from disaster through Moab and Ammon
turning upon the Edomites and slaughtering them.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
To this they refer the phrase in Obadiah 9, <i>the men
of thy covenant have betrayed thee</i>. Others place the
whole book in the reign of Joram of Judah (849—842
<span class="small">B.C.</span>), when, according to the Chronicles,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Judah
was invaded and Jerusalem partly sacked by Philistines
and Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> But in the story of this invasion, there
is no mention of Edomites, and the argument which
is drawn from Joel’s quotation of Obadiah fails if Joel,
as we shall see, be of late date. With greater prudence
Pusey declines to fix a period.</p>

<p>The supporters of a pre-exilic origin for the <i>whole</i>
Book of Obadiah have to explain vv. 11–14, which
appear to reflect Edom’s conduct at the sack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar in 586, and they do
so in two ways. Pusey takes the verses as predictive
of Nebuchadrezzar’s siege. Orelli and others believe
that they suit better the conquest and plunder of the
city in the time of Jehoram. But, as Calvin has
said, “they seem to be mistaken who think that
Obadiah lived before the time of Isaiah.”</p>

<p>The question, however, very early arose, whether
it was possible to take Obadiah as a unity. Vv. 1–9
are more vigorous and firm than vv. 10–21. In vv. 1–9
Edom is destroyed by nations who are its allies; in
vv. 10–21 it is still to fall along with other Gentiles
in the general judgment of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Vv. 10–21
admittedly describe the conduct of the Edomites at
the overthrow of Jerusalem in 586; but vv. 1–9 probably
reflect earlier events; and it is significant that
in them alone occur the parallels to Jeremiah’s prophecy
against Edom in 604. On some of these grounds
Ewald regarded the little book as consisting of two
pieces, both of which refer to Edom, but the first of
which was written before Jeremiah, and the second
is post-exilic. As Jeremiah’s prophecy has some
features more original than Obadiah’s,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> he traced both
prophecies to an original oracle against Edom, of which
Obadiah on the whole renders an exact version. He
fixed the date of this oracle in the earlier days of
Isaiah, when Rezin of Syria enabled Edom to assert
again its independence of Judah, and Edom won back
Elath, which Uzziah had taken.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Driver, Wildeboer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and Cornill<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> adopt this theory, with the exception of
the period to which Ewald refers the original oracle.
According to them, the Book of Obadiah consists
of two pieces, vv. 1–9 pre-exilic, and vv. 10–21 post-exilic
and descriptive in 11–14 of Nebuchadrezzar’s
sack of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>This latter point need not be contested.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> But is it
clear that 1–9 are so different from 10–21 that they
must be assigned to another period? Are they
necessarily pre-exilic? Wellhausen thinks not, and
has constructed still another theory of the origin of
the book, which, like Vatke’s, brings it all down to
the period after the Exile.</p>

<p>There is no mention in the book either of Assyria
or of Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The allies who have betrayed Edom
(ver.&nbsp;7) are therefore probably those Arabian tribes
who surrounded it and were its frequent confederates.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
They are described as <i>sending</i> Edom <i>to the border</i> (<i>ib.</i>).
Wellhausen thinks that this can only refer to the great
northward movement of Arabs which began to press
upon the fertile lands to the south-east of Israel during
the time of the Captivity. Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> prophesies that
Ammon and Moab will disappear before the Arabs, and
we know that by the year 312 the latter were firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
settled in the territories of Edom.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Shortly before this
the Hagarenes appear in Chronicles, and Se’ir is called
by the Arabic name Gebal,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> while as early as the fifth
century “Malachi”<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> records the desolation of Edom’s
territory by the <i>jackals of the wilderness</i>, and the
expulsion of the Edomites, who will not return. The
Edomites were pushed up into the Negeb of Israel,
and occupied the territory round, and to the south of,
Hebron till their conquest by John Hyrcanus about
130; even after that it was called Idumæa.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Wellhausen
would assign Obadiah 1–7 to the same stage
of this movement as is reflected in “Malachi” i. 1–5;
and, apart from certain parentheses, would therefore take
the whole of Obadiah as a unity from the end of the
fifth century before Christ. In that case Giesebrecht
argues that the parallel prophecy, Jeremiah xlix. 7–22,
must be reckoned as one of the passages of the
Book of Jeremiah in which post-exilic additions have
been inserted.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>Our criticism of this theory may start from the
seventh verse of Obadiah: <i>To the border they have sent
thee, all the men of thy covenant have betrayed thee, they
have overpowered thee, the men of thy peace.</i> On our
present knowledge of the history of Edom it is impossible
to assign the first of these clauses to any
period before the Exile. No doubt in earlier days
Edom was more than once subjected to Arab <i>razzias</i>.
But up to the Jewish Exile the Edomites were still in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
possession of their own land. So the Deuteronomist<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
implies, and so Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> and perhaps the author of
Lamentations.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Wellhausen’s claim, therefore, that
the seventh verse of Obadiah refers to the expulsion
of Edomites by Arabs in the sixth or fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>
may be granted.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> But does this mean that verses 1–6
belong, as he maintains, to the same period? A
negative answer seems required by the following facts.
To begin with, the seventh verse is not found in the
parallel prophecy in Jeremiah. There is no reason
why it should not have been used there, if that
prophecy had been compiled at a time when the expulsion
of the Edomites was already an accomplished
fact. But both by this omission and by all its other
features, that prophecy suits the time of Jeremiah,
and we may leave it, therefore, where it was left till
the appearance of Wellhausen’s theory—namely, with
Jeremiah himself.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Moreover Jeremiah xlix. 9 seems
to have been adapted in Obadiah 5 in order to suit
verse 6. But again, Obadiah 1–6, which contains so
many parallels to Jeremiah’s prophecy, also seems to
imply that the Edomites are still in possession of their
land. <i>The nations</i> (we may understand by this the
Arab tribes) are risen against Edom, and Edom is
already despicable in face of them (vv. 1, 2); but he
has not yet fallen, any more than, to the writer of Isaiah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
xlv.—xlvii., who uses analogous language, Babylon is
already fallen. Edom is weak and cannot resist the
Arab <i>razzias</i>. But he still makes his eyrie on high and
says: <i>Who will bring me down?</i> To which challenge
Jehovah replies, not ‘I have brought thee down,’ but
<i>I will bring thee down</i>. The post-exilic portion of
Obadiah, then, I take to begin with verse 7; and the
author of this prophecy has begun by incorporating
in vv. 1–6 a pre-exilic prophecy against Edom, which
had been already, and with more freedom, used by
Jeremiah. Verses 8–9 form a difficulty. They return
to the future tense, as if the Edomites were still to
be cut off from Mount Esau. But verse 10, as
Wellhausen points out, follows on naturally to verse 7,
and, with its successors, clearly points to a period subsequent
to Nebuchadrezzar’s overthrow of Jerusalem.
The change from the past tense in vv. 10–11 to the
imperatives of 12–14 need cause, in spite of what Pusey
says, no difficulty, but may be accounted for by the
excited feelings of the prophet. The suggestion has
been made, and it is plausible, that Obadiah speaks as
an eye-witness of that awful time. Certainly there
is nothing in the rest of the prophecy (vv. 15–21)
to lead us to bring it further down than the years
following the destruction of Jerusalem. Everything
points to the Jews being still in exile. The verbs
which describe the inviolateness of Jerusalem (17), and
the reinstatement of Israel in their heritage (17, 19),
and their conquest of Edom (18), are all in the future.
The prophet himself appears to write in exile (20).
The captivity of Jerusalem is in Sepharad (<i>ib.</i>) and the
<i>saviours</i> have to <i>come up</i> to Mount Zion; that is to
say, they are still beyond the Holy Land (21).<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
The one difficulty in assigning this date to the prophecy
is that nothing is said in the Hebrew of ver.&nbsp;19
about the re-occupation of the hill-country of Judæa
itself, but here the Greek may help us.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Certainly
every other feature suits the early days of the
Exile.</p>

<p>The result of our inquiry is that the Book of
Obadiah was written at that time by a prophet in exile,
who was filled by the same hatred of Edom as filled
another exile, who in Babylon wrote Psalm cxxxvii.;
and that, like so many of the exilic writers, he started
from an earlier prophecy against Edom, already used
by Jeremiah.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> [Nowack (<i>Comm.</i>, 1897) takes vv. 1–14
(with additions in vv. 1, 5, 6, 8f. and 12) to be from
a date not long after the Fall of Jerusalem, alluded
to in vv. 11–14; and vv. 15–21 to belong to a later
period, which it is impossible to fix exactly.]</p>

<p>There is nothing in the language of the book to
disturb this conclusion. The Hebrew of Obadiah is
pure; unlike its neighbour, the Book of Jonah, it
contains neither Aramaisms nor other symptoms of
decadence. The text is very sound. The Septuagint
Version enables us to correct vv. 7 and 17, offers the
true division between vv. 9 and 10, but makes an
omission which leaves no sense in ver.&nbsp;17.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> It will

<p class="captitle">EDOM AND ISRAEL</p>

<p class="csubtitle">O<span class="small">BADIAH</span> 1–21</p>

<p class="noindent">If the Book of Obadiah presents us with some of
the most difficult questions of criticism, it raises
besides one of the hardest ethical problems in all the
vexed history of Israel.</p>

<p>Israel’s fate has been to work out their calling in
the world through antipathies rather than by sympathies,
but of all the antipathies which the nation
experienced none was more bitter and more constant
than that towards Edom. The rest of Israel’s enemies
rose and fell like waves: Canaanites were succeeded
by Philistines, Philistines by Syrians, Syrians by
Greeks. Tyrant relinquished his grasp of God’s
people to tyrant: Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian,
Persian; the Seleucids, the Ptolemies. But Edom
was always there, <i>and fretted his anger for ever</i>.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
From that far back day when their ancestors wrestled
in the womb of Rebekah to the very eve of the
Christian era, when a Jewish king<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> dragged the
Idumeans beneath the yoke of the Law, the two
peoples scorned, hated and scourged each other, with
a relentlessness that finds no analogy, between kindred
and neighbour nations, anywhere else in history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
About 1030 David, about 130 the Hasmoneans, were
equally at war with Edom; and few are the prophets
between those distant dates who do not cry for
vengeance against him or exult in his overthrow.
The Book of Obadiah is singular in this, that it contains
nothing else than such feelings and such cries.
It brings no spiritual message. It speaks no word
of sin, or of righteousness, or of mercy, but only doom
upon Edom in bitter resentment at his cruelties, and
in exultation that, as he has helped to disinherit Israel,
Israel shall disinherit him. Such a book among the
prophets surprises us. It seems but a dark surge
staining the stream of revelation, as if to exhibit
through what a muddy channel these sacred waters
have been poured upon the world. Is the book only
an outbreak of Israel’s selfish patriotism? This is the
question we have to discuss in the present chapter.</p>

<p>Reasons for the hostility of Edom and Israel are not
far to seek. The two nations were neighbours with
bitter memories and rival interests. Each of them was
possessed by a strong sense of distinction from the
rest of mankind, which goes far to justify the story
of their common descent. But while in Israel this
pride was chiefly due to the consciousness of a peculiar
destiny not yet realised—a pride painful and hungry—in
Edom it took the complacent form of satisfaction
in a territory of remarkable isolation and self-sufficiency,
in large stores of wealth, and in a reputation for worldly
wisdom—a fulness that recked little of the future, and
felt no need of the Divine.</p>

<p>The purple mountains, into which the wild sons of
Esau clambered, run out from Syria upon the desert,
some hundred miles by twenty of porphyry and red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
sandstone. They are said to be the finest rock scenery
in the world. “Salvator Rosa never conceived so
savage and so suitable a haunt for banditti.”<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> From
Mount Hor, which is their summit, you look down
upon a maze of mountains, cliffs, chasms, rocky shelves
and strips of valley. On the east the range is but the
crested edge of a high, cold plateau, covered for the
most part by stones, but with stretches of corn land
and scattered woods. The western walls, on the
contrary, spring steep and bare, black and red, from
the yellow of the desert ‘Arabah. The interior is
reached by defiles, so narrow that two horsemen may
scarcely ride abreast, and the sun is shut out by
the overhanging rocks. Eagles, hawks and other
mountain birds fly screaming round the traveller.
Little else than wild-fowls’ nests are the villages;
human eyries perched on high shelves or hidden away
in caves at the ends of the deep gorges. There is
abundance of water. The gorges are filled with
tamarisks, oleanders and wild figs. Besides the wheat
lands on the eastern plateau, the wider defiles hold
fertile fields and terraces for the vine. Mount Esau is,
therefore, no mere citadel with supplies for a limited
siege, but a well-stocked, well-watered country, full of
food and lusty men, yet lifted so high, and locked so
fast by precipice and slippery mountain, that it calls
for little trouble of defence. <i>Dweller in the clefts of the
rock, the height is his habitation, that saith in his heart:
Who shall bring me down to earth?</i><a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>On this rich fortress-land the Edomites enjoyed a
civilisation far above that of the tribes who swarmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
upon the surrounding deserts; and at the same time
they were cut off from the lands of those Syrian nations
who were their equals in culture and descent. When
Edom looked out of himself, he looked <i>down</i> and <i>across</i>—down
upon the Arabs, whom his position enabled
him to rule with a loose, rough hand, and across at
his brothers in Palestine, forced by their more open
territories to make alliances with and against each
other, from all of which he could afford to hold himself
free. That alone was bound to exasperate them. In
Edom himself it appears to have bred a want of
sympathy, a habit of keeping to himself and ignoring
the claims both of pity and of kinship—with which
he is charged by all the prophets. <i>He corrupted his
natural feelings, and watched his passion for ever.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> Thou
stoodest aloof!</i><a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>This self-sufficiency was aggravated by the position
of the country among several of the main routes of
ancient trade. The masters of Mount Se’ir held the
harbours of ‘Akaba, into which the gold ships came
from Ophir. They intercepted the Arabian caravans
and cut the roads to Gaza and Damascus. Petra, in
the very heart of Edom, was in later times the capital
of the Nabatean kingdom, whose commerce rivalled that
of Phœnicia, scattering its inscriptions from Teyma in
Central Arabia up to the very gates of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The
earlier Edomites were also traders, middlemen between
Arabia and the Phœnicians; and they filled their
caverns with the wealth both of East and West.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
There can be little doubt that it was this which first
drew the envious hand of Israel upon a land so cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
off from their own and so difficult of invasion. Hear
the exultation of the ancient prophet whose words
Obadiah has borrowed: <i>How searched out is Esau,
and his hidden treasures rifled!</i><a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> But the same is clear
from the history. Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Amaziah,
Uzziah and other Jewish invaders of Edom were all
ambitious to command the Eastern trade through Elath
and Ezion-geber. For this it was necessary to subdue
Edom; and the frequent reduction of the country to a
vassal state, with the revolts in which it broke free,
were accompanied by terrible cruelties upon both
sides.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Every century increased the tale of bitter
memories between the brothers, and added the horrors
of a war of revenge to those of a war for gold.</p>

<p>The deepest springs of their hate, however, bubbled
in their blood. In genius, temper and ambition, the
two peoples were of opposite extremes. It is very
singular that we never hear in the Old Testament of
the Edomite gods. Israel fell under the fascination of
every neighbouring idolatry, but does not even mention
that Edom had a religion. Such a silence cannot be
accidental, and the inference which it suggests is
confirmed by the picture drawn of Esau himself. Esau
is a <i>profane person</i><a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>; with no conscience of a birthright,
no faith in the future, no capacity for visions; dead to
the unseen, and clamouring only for the satisfaction
of his appetites. The same was probably the character
of his descendants; who had, of course, their own
gods, like every other people in that Semitic world,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
but were essentially irreligious, living for food, spoil
and vengeance, with no national conscience or ideals—a
kind of people who deserved even more than the
Philistines to have their name descend to our times
as a symbol of hardness and obscurantism. It is no
contradiction to all this that the one intellectual quality
imputed to the Edomites should be that of shrewdness
and a wisdom which was obviously worldly. <i>The
wise men of Edom, the cleverness of Mount Esau</i><a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> were
notorious. It is the race which has given to history
only the Herods—clever, scheming, ruthless statesmen,
as able as they were false and bitter, as shrewd in
policy as they were destitute of ideals. <i>That fox</i>,
cried Christ, and crying stamped the race.</p>

<p>But of such a national character Israel was in all
points, save that of cunning, essentially the reverse.
Who had such a passion for the ideal? Who such a
hunger for the future, such hopes or such visions?
Never more than in the day of their prostration, when
Jerusalem and the sanctuary fell in ruins, did they feel
and hate the hardness of the brother, who <i>stood aloof</i>
and <i>made large his mouth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>It is, therefore, no mere passion for revenge, which
inspires these few, hot verses of Obadiah. No doubt,
bitter memories rankle in his heart. He eagerly repeats<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
the voices of a day when Israel matched Edom
in cruelty and was cruel for the sake of gold, when
Judah’s kings coveted Esau’s treasures and were foiled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
No doubt there is exultation in the news he hears, that
these treasures have been rifled by others; that all
the cleverness of this proud people has not availed
against its treacherous allies; and that it has been
sent packing to its borders.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> But beneath such savage
tempers, there beats the heart which has fought and
suffered for the highest things, and now in its martyrdom
sees them baffled and mocked by a people without
vision and without feeling. Justice, mercy and truth;
the education of humanity in the law of God, the
establishment of His will upon earth—these things, it
is true, are not mentioned in the Book of Obadiah, but
it is for the sake of some dim instinct of them that its
wrath is poured upon foes whose treachery and malice
seek to make them impossible by destroying the one
people on earth who then believed and lived for them.
Consider the situation. It was the darkest hour of
Israel’s history. City and Temple had fallen, the people
had been carried away. Up over the empty land the
waves of mocking heathen had flowed, there was none
to beat them back. A Jew who had lived through
these things, who had seen<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> the day of Jerusalem’s
fall and passed from her ruins under the mocking of
her foes, dared to cry back into the large mouths they
made: Our day is not spent; we shall return with
the things we live for; the land shall yet be ours, and
the kingdom our God’s.</p>

<p>Brave, hot heart! It shall be as thou sayest; it
shall be for a brief season. But in exile thy people
and thou have first to learn many more things about
the heathen than you can now feel. Mix with them
on that far-off coast, from which thou criest. Learn
what the world is, and that more beautiful and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
possible than the narrow rule which thou hast promised
to Israel over her neighbours shall be that worldwide
service of man, of which, in fifty years, all the best of
thy people shall be dreaming.</p>

<p>The Book of Obadiah at the beginning of the Exile,
and the great prophecy of the Servant at the end of
it—how true was his word who said: <i>He that goeth
forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless
come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</i></p>

<p class="thb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subsequent history of Israel and Edom may be
quickly traced. When the Jews returned from exile
they found the Edomites in possession of all the Negeb,
and of the Mountain of Judah far north of Hebron.
The old warfare was resumed, and not till 130 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
(as has been already said) did a Jewish king bring
the old enemies of his people beneath the Law of
Jehovah. The Jewish scribes transferred the name
of Edom to Rome, as if it were the perpetual symbol
of that hostility of the heathen world, against which
Israel had to work out her calling as the peculiar
people of God. Yet Israel had not done with the
Edomites themselves. Never did she encounter foes
more dangerous to her higher interests than in her
Idumean dynasty of the Herods; while the savage
relentlessness of certain Edomites in the last struggles
against Rome proved that the fire which had scorched
her borders for a thousand years, now burned a still
more fatal flame within her. More than anything
else, this Edomite fanaticism provoked the splendid
suicide of Israel, which beginning in Galilee was consummated
upon the rocks of Masada, half-way between
Jerusalem and Mount Esau.</p>

Zechariah, Malachi and perhaps Joel—fall within
the period of the Persian Empire. The Persian Empire
was founded on the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus in
539 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and it fell in the defeat of Darius III. by
Alexander the Great at the battle of Gaugamela, or
Arbela, in 331. The period is thus one of a little more
than two centuries.</p>

<p>During all this time Israel were the subjects of the
Persian monarchs, and bound to them and their civilisation
by the closest of ties. They owed them their
liberty and revival as a separate community upon its
own land. The Jewish State—if we may give that
title to what is perhaps more truly described as a
Congregation or Commune—was part of an empire
which stretched from the Ægean to the Indus, and the
provinces of which were held in close intercourse by
the first system of roads and posts that ever brought
different races together. Jews were scattered almost
everywhere across this empire. A vast number still
remained in Babylon, and there were many at Susa
and Ecbatana, two of the royal capitals. Most of these
were subject to the full influence of Aryan manners
and religion; some were even members of the Persian
Court and had access to the Royal Presence. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Delta of Egypt there were Jewish settlements, and
Jews were found also throughout Syria and along the
coasts, at least, of Asia Minor. Here they touched
another civilisation, destined to impress them in the
future even more deeply than the Persian. It is the
period of the struggle between Asia and Europe, between
Persia and Greece: the period of Marathon and Thermopylæ,
of Salamis and Platæa, of Xenophon and the
Ten Thousand. Greek fleets occupied Cyprus and
visited the Delta. Greek armies—in the pay of Persia—trod
for the first time the soil of Syria.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>In such a world, dominated for the first time by the
Aryan, Jews returned from exile, rebuilt their Temple
and resumed its ritual, revived Prophecy and codified
the Law: in short, restored and organised Israel as the
people of God, and developed their religion to those
ultimate forms in which it has accomplished its supreme
service to the world.</p>

<p>In this period Prophecy does not maintain that
lofty position which it has hitherto held in the life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of Israel, and the reasons for its decline are obvious.
To begin with, the national life, from which it springs,
is of a far poorer quality. Israel is no longer a kingdom,
but a colony. The state is not independent:
there is virtually no state. The community is poor
and feeble, cut off from all the habit and prestige of
their past, and beginning the rudiments of life again
in hard struggle with nature and hostile tribes. To
this level Prophecy has to descend, and occupy itself
with these rudiments. We miss the civic atmosphere,
the great spaces of public life, the large ethical issues.
Instead we have tearful questions, raised by a grudging
soil and bad seasons, with all the petty selfishness of
hunger-bitten peasants. The religious duties of the
colony are mainly ecclesiastical: the building of a
temple, the arrangement of ritual, and the ceremonial
discipline of the people in separation from their heathen
neighbours. We miss, too, the clear outlook of the
earlier prophets upon the history of the world, and
their calm, rational grasp of its forces. The world is
still seen, and even to further distances than before.
The people abate no whit of their ideal to be the
teachers of mankind. But it is all through another
medium. The lurid air of Apocalypse envelops the
future, and in their weakness to grapple either politically
or philosophically with the problems which
history offers, the prophets resort to the expectation
of physical catastrophes and of the intervention of
supernatural armies. Such an atmosphere is not
the native air of Prophecy, and Prophecy yields its
supreme office in Israel to other forms of religious
development. On one side the ecclesiastic comes to
the front—the legalist, the organiser of ritual, the
priest; on another, the teacher, the moralist, the thinker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and the speculator. At the same time personal religion
is perhaps more deeply cultivated than at any other
stage of the people’s history. A large number of
lyrical pieces bear proof to the existence of a very
genuine and beautiful piety throughout the period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Jewish records for this time are
both fragmentary and confused; they touch the general
history of the world only at intervals, and give rise to
a number of difficult questions, some of which are insoluble.
The clearest and only consecutive line of
data through the period is the list of the Persian
monarchs. The Persian Empire, 539—331, was sustained
through eleven reigns and two usurpations, of
which the following is a chronological table:—</p>

<p>Of these royal names, Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes (Ahasuerus)
and Artaxerxes are given among the Biblical
data; but the fact that there are three Darius’, two
Xerxes’ and three Artaxerxes’ makes possible more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
than one set of identifications, and has suggested
different chronological schemes of Jewish history
during this period. The simplest and most generally
accepted identification of the Darius, Xerxes (Ahasuerus)
and Artaxerxes of the Biblical history,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> is
that they were the first Persian monarchs of these
names; and after needful rearrangement of the somewhat
confused order of events in the narrative of the
Book of Ezra, it was held as settled that, while the
exiles returned under Cyrus about 537, Haggai and
Zechariah prophesied and the Temple was built under
Darius I. between the second and the sixth year of his
reign, or from 520 to 516; that attempts were made to
build the walls of Jerusalem under Xerxes I. (485—464),
but especially under Artaxerxes I. (464—424), under
whom first Ezra in 458 and then Nehemiah in 445
arrived at Jerusalem, promulgated the Law and reorganised
Israel.</p>

<p>But this has by no means satisfied all modern
critics. Some in the interests of the authenticity
and correct order of the Book of Ezra, and some for
other reasons, argue that the Darius under whom the
Temple was built was Darius II., or Nothus, 423—404,
and thus bring down the building of the Temple and
the prophets Haggai and Zechariah a whole century
later than the accepted theory;<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> and that therefore
the Artaxerxes, under whom Ezra and Nehemiah
laboured, was not the first Artaxerxes, or Longimanus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
(464—424), but the second, or Mnemon (404—358).<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
This arrangement of the history finds some support
in the data, and especially in the <i>order</i> of the data,
furnished by the Book of Ezra, which describes the
building of the Temple under Darius <i>after</i> its record of
events under Xerxes I. (Ahasuerus) and Artaxerxes I.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
But, as we shall see in the next chapter, the Compiler
of the Book of Ezra has seen fit, for some reason, to
violate the chronological order of the data at his disposal,
and nothing reliable can be built upon his
arrangement. Unravel his somewhat confused history,
take the contemporary data supplied in Haggai and
Zechariah, add to them the historical probabilities of
the time, and you will find, as the three Dutch scholars
Kuenen, Van Hoonacker and Kosters have done,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> that
the rebuilding of the Temple cannot possibly be dated
so late as the reign of the second Darius (423—404),
but must be left, according to the usual acceptation,
under Darius I. (521—485). Haggai, for instance,
plainly implies that among those who saw the Temple
rising were men who had seen its predecessor
destroyed in 586,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> and Zechariah declares that God’s
wrath on Jerusalem has just lasted seventy years.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
Nor (however much his confusion may give grounds
to the contrary) can the Compiler of the Book of Ezra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
have meant any other reign for the building of the
Temple than that of Darius I. He mentions that
nothing was done to the Temple <i>all the days of
Cyrus and up to the reign of Darius</i>:<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> by this he cannot
intend to pass over the first Darius and leap on
three more reigns, or a century, to Darius II. He
mentions Zerubbabel and Jeshua both as at the head
of the exiles who returned under Cyrus, and as presiding
at the building of the Temple under Darius.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
If alive in 536, they may well have been alive in
521, but cannot have survived till 423.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> These data
are fully supported by the historical probabilities. It
is inconceivable that the Jews should have delayed
the building of the Temple for more than a century
from the time of Cyrus. That the Temple was built
by Zerubbabel and Jeshua in the beginning of the
reign of Darius I. may be considered as one of the
unquestionable data of our period.</p>

<p>But if this be so, then there falls away a great part
of the argument for placing the building of the walls
of Jerusalem and the labours of Ezra and Nehemiah
under Artaxerxes II. (404—358) instead of Artaxerxes
I. It is true that some who accept the building
of the Temple under Darius I. nevertheless put
Ezra and Nehemiah under Artaxerxes II. The weakness
of their case, however, has been clearly exposed
by Kuenen,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> who proves that Nehemiah’s mission to
Jerusalem must have fallen in the twentieth year of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Artaxerxes I., or 445.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> “On this fact there can be no
further difference of opinion.”<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>These two dates then are fixed: the beginning of
the Temple in 520 by Zerubbabel and Jeshua, and the
arrival of Nehemiah at Jerusalem in 445. Other points
are more difficult to establish, and in particular there
rests a great obscurity on the date of the two visits of
Ezra to Jerusalem. According to the Book of Ezra,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
he went there first in the seventh year of Artaxerxes I.,
or 458 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, thirteen years before the arrival of Nehemiah.
He found many Jews married to heathen wives, laid it
to heart, and called a general assembly of the people
to drive the latter out of the community. Then we
hear no more of him: neither in the negotiations with
Artaxerxes about the building of the walls, nor upon
the arrival of Nehemiah, nor in Nehemiah’s treatment
of the mixed marriages. He is absent from everything,
till suddenly he appears again at the dedication of the
walls by Nehemiah and at the reading of the Law.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
This “eclipse of Ezra,” as Kuenen well calls it, taken
with the mixed character of all the records left of him,
has moved some to deny to him and his reforms and
his promulgation of the Law any historical reality
whatever;<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> while others, with a more sober and rational
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
criticism, have sought to solve the difficulties by another
arrangement of the events than that usually accepted.
Van Hoonacker makes Ezra’s <i>first</i> appearance in
Jerusalem to be at the dedication of the walls and
promulgation of the Law in 445, and refers his
arrival described in Ezra vii. and his attempts to
abolish the mixed marriages to a second visit to
Jerusalem in the twentieth year, not of Artaxerxes I.,
but of Artaxerxes II., or 398 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Kuenen has exposed
the extreme unlikelihood, if not impossibility, of so late
a date for Ezra, and in this Kosters holds with him.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
But Kosters agrees with Van Hoonacker in placing
Ezra’s activity subsequent to Nehemiah’s and to the
dedication of the walls.</p>

<p>These questions about Ezra have little bearing on
our present study of the prophets, and it is not our
duty to discuss them. But Kuenen, in answer to Van
Hoonacker, has shown very strong reasons<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> for holding
in the main to the generally accepted theory of Ezra’s
arrival in Jerusalem in 458, the seventh year of
Artaxerxes I.; and though there are great difficulties
about the narrative which follows, and especially
about Ezra’s sudden disappearance from the scene till
after Nehemiah’s arrival, reasons may be found for
this.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
We are therefore justified in holding, in the meantime,
to the traditional arrangement of the great events in
Israel in the fifth century before Christ. We may
divide the whole Persian period by the two points we
have found to be certain, the beginning of the Temple
under Darius I. in 520 and the mission of Nehemiah
to Jerusalem in 445, and by the other that we have
found to be probable, Ezra’s arrival in 458.</p>

<p>On these data the Persian period may be arranged
under the following four sections, among which we place
those prophets who respectively belong to them:—</p>

<p>1. From the Taking of Babylon by Cyrus to the
Completion of the Temple in the sixth year of Darius I.,
538—516: Haggai and Zechariah in 520 ff.</p>

<p>2. From the Completion of the Temple under
Darius I. to the arrival of Ezra in the seventh year
of Artaxerxes I., 516—458: sometimes called the
period of silence, but probably yielding the Book of
“Malachi.”</p>

<p>3. The Work of Ezra and Nehemiah under Artaxerxes
I., Longimanus, 458—425.</p>

<p>4. The Rest of the Period, Xerxes II. to Darius III.,
425—331: the prophet Joel and perhaps several other
anonymous fragments of prophecy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of these four sections we must now examine
the first, for it forms the necessary introduction to
our study of Haggai and Zechariah, and above all
it raises a question almost greater than any of those
we have just been discussing. The fact recorded by
the Book of Ezra, and till a few years ago accepted
without doubt by tradition and modern criticism, the
first Return of Exiles from Babylon under Cyrus, has
lately been altogether denied; and the builders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Temple in 520 have been asserted to be, not returned
exiles, but the remnant of Jews left in Judah by
Nebuchadrezzar in 586. The importance of this for
our interpretation of Haggai and Zechariah, who
instigated the building of the Temple, is obvious: we
must discuss the question in detail.</p>

<p class="captitle">FROM THE RETURN FROM BABYLON TO THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</p>

<p class="csubtitle">(536—516 <span class="small">B.C.</span>)</p>

<p class="noindent">Cyrus the Great took Babylon and the Babylonian
Empire in 539. Upon the eve of his conquest
the Second Isaiah had hailed him as the Liberator
of the people of God and the builder of their Temple.
The Return of the Exiles and the Restoration both
of Temple and City were predicted by the Second
Isaiah for the immediate future; and a Jewish historian,
the Compiler of the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, who
lived about 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, has taken up the story of how
these events came to pass from the very first year of
Cyrus onward. Before discussing the dates and proper
order of these events, it will be well to have this
Chronicler’s narrative before us. It lies in the first
and following chapters of our Book of Ezra.</p>

<p>According to this, Cyrus, soon after his conquest
of Babylon, gave permission to the Jewish exiles to
return to Palestine, and between forty and fifty thousand<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
did so return, bearing the vessels of Jehovah’s
house which the Chaldeans had taken away in 586.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
These Cyrus delivered <i>to Sheshbazzar, prince of Judah</i><a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
(who is further described in an Aramaic document
incorporated by the Compiler of the Book of Ezra
as “Peḥah,” or <i>provincial governor</i>,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> and as laying the
foundation of the Temple<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>), and there is also mentioned
in command of the people a Tirshatha, probably the
Persian Tarsâta,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> which also means <i>provincial governor</i>.
Upon their arrival at Jerusalem, the date of which
will be immediately discussed, the people are said to
be under Jeshu’a ben Jōṣadak<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> and Zerubbabel ben
She’altî’el,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> who had already been mentioned as the
head of the returning exiles,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> and who is called by
his contemporary Haggai Peḥah, or <i>governor, of
Judah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Are we to understand by Sheshbazzar and
Zerubbabel one and the same person? Most critics
have answered in the affirmative, believing that Sheshbazzar
is but the Babylonian or Persian name by
which the Jew Zerubbabel was known at court;<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> and
this view is supported by the facts that Zerubbabel was
of the house of David and is called Peḥah by Haggai,
and by the argument that the command given by
the Tirshatha to the Jews to abstain from <i>eating the
most holy things</i><a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> could only have been given by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
native Jew.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> But others, arguing that Ezra v. 1, compared
with vv. 14 and 16, implies that Zerubbabel
and Sheshbazzar were two different persons, take
the former to have been the most prominent of the
Jews themselves, but the latter an official, Persian or
Babylonian, appointed by Cyrus to carry out such
business in connection with the Return as could only
be discharged by an imperial officer.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> This is, on the
whole, the more probable theory.</p>

<p>If it is right, Sheshbazzar, who superintended the
Return, had disappeared from Jerusalem by 521, when
Haggai commenced to prophesy, and had been succeeded
as Peḥah, or governor, by Zerubbabel. But in that case
the Compiler has been in error in calling Sheshbazzar
<i>a prince of Judah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>The next point to fix is what the Compiler considers
to have been the date of the Return. He names no
year, but he recounts that the same people, whom he
has just described as receiving the command of Cyrus
to return, did immediately leave Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and he says
that they arrived at Jerusalem in <i>the seventh month</i>,
but again without stating a year.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> In any case, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
obviously intends to imply that the Return followed
immediately on reception of the permission to return,
and that this was given by Cyrus very soon after his
occupation of Babylon in 539—8. We may take it that
the Compiler understood the year to be that we know
as 537 <span class="small">B.C.</span> He adds that, on the arrival of the
caravans from Babylon, the Jews set up the altar on
its old site and restored the morning and evening
sacrifices; that they kept also the Feast of Tabernacles,
and thereafter all the rest of the <i>feasts of Jehovah</i>; and
further, that they engaged masons and carpenters for
building the Temple, and Phœnicians to bring them
cedar-wood from Lebanon.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Another section from the Compiler’s hand states that
the returned Jews set to work upon the Temple <i>in the
second month of the second year</i> of their Return, presumably
536 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, laying the foundation-stone with due
pomp, and amid the excitement of the whole people.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
Whereupon certain <i>adversaries</i>, by whom the Compiler
means Samaritans, demanded a share in the building of
the Temple, and when Jeshua and Zerubbabel refused
this, <i>the people of the land</i> frustrated the building of the
Temple even until the reign of Darius, 521 ff.</p>

<p>This—the second year of Darius—is the point to
which contemporary documents, the prophecies of
Haggai and Zechariah, assign the beginning of
new measures to build the Temple. Of these the
Compiler of the Book of Ezra says in the meantime
nothing, but after barely mentioning the reign
of Darius leaps at once<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> to further Samaritan
obstructions—though not of the building of the
Temple (be it noted), but of the building of the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
walls—in the reigns of Ahasuerus, that is Xerxes,
presumably Xerxes I., the successor of Darius, 485—464,
and of his successor Artaxerxes I., 464—424;<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> the
account of the latter of which he gives not in his own
language but in that of an Aramaic document, Ezra iv. 8 ff.
And this document, after recounting how Artaxerxes
empowered the Samaritans to stop the building of the
walls of Jerusalem, records<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> that the building ceased
<i>till the second year of the reign of Darius</i>, when the
prophets Haggai and Zechariah stirred up Zerubbabel
and Jeshua to rebuild, not the city walls, be it observed,
but the Temple, and with the permission of Darius
this building was at last completed in his sixth year.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
That is to say, this Aramaic document brings us back,
with <i>the frustrated building of the walls</i> under Xerxes I.
and Artaxerxes I. (485—424), to the same date under
their predecessor Darius I., viz. 520, to which the
Compiler had brought down <i>the frustrated building of
the Temple</i>! The most reasonable explanation of this
confusion, not only of chronology, but of two distinct
processes—the erection of the Temple and the fortification
of the city—is that the Compiler was misled by
his desire to give as strong an impression as possible
of the Samaritan obstructions by placing them all
together. Attempts to harmonise the order of his
narrative with the ascertained sequence of the Persian
reigns have failed.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Such then is the character of the compilation known
to us as the Book of Ezra. If we add that in its
present form it cannot be of earlier date than 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
or two hundred and thirty-six years after the Return,
and that the Aramaic document which it incorporates
is probably not earlier than 430, or one hundred years
after the Return, while the List of Exiles which it
gives (in chap. ii.) also contains elements that cannot
be earlier than 430, we shall not wonder that grave
doubts should have been raised concerning its trustworthiness
as a narrative.</p>

<p>These doubts affect, with one exception, all the great
facts which it professes to record. The exception is
the building of the Temple between the second and
sixth years of Darius I., 520—516, which we have
already seen to be past doubt.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> But all that the
Book of Ezra relates before this has been called in
question, and it has been successively alleged: (1)
that there was no such attempt as the book describes
to build the Temple before 520, (2) that there was
no Return of Exiles at all under Cyrus, and that
the Temple was not built by Jews who had come from
Babylon, but by Jews who had never left Judah.</p>

<p>These conclusions, if justified, would have the most
important bearing upon our interpretation of Haggai
and Zechariah. It is therefore necessary to examine
them with care. They were reached by critics in the
order just stated, but as the second is the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
sweeping and to some extent involves the other, we
may take it first.</p>

<p>1. Is the Book of Ezra, then, right or wrong in
asserting that there was a great return of Jews, headed
by Zerubbabel and Jeshua, about the year 536, and that
it was they who in 520—516 rebuilt the Temple?</p>

<p>The argument that in recounting these events the
Book of Ezra is unhistorical has been fully stated by
Professor Kosters of Leiden.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> He reaches his conclusion
along three lines of evidence: the Books of Haggai
and Zechariah, the sources from which he believes the
Aramaic narrative Ezra v. 1—vi. 18 to have been
compiled, and the list of names in Ezra ii. In the
Books of Haggai and Zechariah, he points out that
the inhabitants of Jerusalem whom the prophets summon
to build the Temple are not called by any name
which implies that they are returned exiles; that nothing
in the description of them would lead us to suppose
this; that God’s anger against Israel is represented as
still unbroken; that neither prophet speaks of a Return
as past, but that Zechariah seems to look for it as still
to come.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> The second line of evidence is an analysis
of the Aramaic document, Ezra v. 6 ff., into two
sources, neither of which implies a Return under Cyrus.
But these two lines of proof cannot avail against the
List of Returned Exiles offered us in Ezra ii. and
Nehemiah vii., if the latter be genuine. On his third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
line of evidence, Dr. Kosters, therefore, disputes the
genuineness of this List, and further denies that it
even gives itself out as a List of Exiles returned under
Cyrus. So he arrives at the conclusion that there was
no Return from Babylon under Cyrus, nor any before
the Temple was built in 520 ff., but that the builders
were <i>people of the land</i>, Jews who had never gone
into exile.</p>

<p>The evidence which Dr. Kosters draws from the
Book of Ezra least concerns us. Both because of this
and because it is the weakest part of his case, we may
take it first.</p>

<p>Dr. Kosters analyses the bulk of the Aramaic document,
Ezra v.—vi. 18, into two constituents. His arguments
for this are very precarious.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> The first document,
which he takes to consist of chap. v. 1–5 and 10, with
perhaps vi. 6–15 (except a few phrases), relates that
Thathnai, Satrap of the West of the Euphrates, asked
Darius whether he might allow the Jews to proceed
with the building of the Temple, and received command
not only to allow but to help them, on the ground
that Cyrus had already given them permission. The
second, chap. v. 11–17, vi. 1–3, affirms that the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
had actually begun under Cyrus, who had sent Sheshbazzar,
the Satrap, to see it carried out. Neither of
these documents says a word about any order from
Cyrus to the Jews to return; and the implication of the
second, that the building had gone on uninterruptedly
from the time of Cyrus’ order to the second year of
Darius,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> is not in harmony with the evidence of the
Compiler of the Book of Ezra, who, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
states that Samaritan obstruction stayed the building
till the second year of Darius.</p>

<p>But suppose we accept Kosters’ premisses and agree
that these two documents really exist within Ezra v.—vi. 18.
Their evidence is not irreconcilable. Both imply
that Cyrus gave command to rebuild the Temple: if they
were originally independent that would but strengthen
the tradition of such a command, and render a little
weaker Dr. Kosters’ contention that the tradition arose
merely from a desire to find a fulfilment of the Second
Isaiah’s predictions<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> that Cyrus would be the Temple’s
builder. That neither of the supposed documents mentions
the Return itself is very natural, because both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
are concerned with the building of the Temple. For
the Compiler of the Book of Ezra, who on Kosters’
argument put them together, the interest of the Return
is over; he has already sufficiently dealt with it. But
more—Kosters’ second document, which ascribes the
building of the Temple to Cyrus, surely by that very
statement implies a Return of Exiles during his reign.
For is it at all probable that Cyrus would have committed
the rebuilding of the Temple to a Persian
magnate like Sheshbazzar, without sending with him
a large number of those Babylonian Jews who must
have instigated the king to give his order for rebuilding?
We may conclude then that Ezra v.—vi. 18, whatever be
its value and its date, contains no evidence, positive or
negative, against a Return of the Jews under Cyrus,
but, on the contrary, takes this for granted.</p>

<p>We turn now to Dr. Kosters’ treatment of the so-called
List of the Returned Exiles. He holds this
List to have been, not only borrowed for its place in
Ezra ii. from Nehemiah vii.,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> but even interpolated
in the latter. His reasons for this latter conclusion
are very improbable, as will be seen from the appended
note, and really weaken his otherwise strong case.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
As to the contents of the List, there are, it is true,
many elements which date from Nehemiah’s own time
and even later. But these are not sufficient to prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
that the List was not originally a List of Exiles returned
under Cyrus. The verses in which this is asserted—Ezra
ii. 1, 2; Nehemiah vii. 6, 7—plainly intimate that
those Jews who came up out of the Exile were the
same who built the Temple under Darius. Dr. Kosters
endeavours to destroy the force of this statement (if
true so destructive of his theory) by pointing to the
number of the leaders which the List assigns to the
returning exiles. In fixing this number as twelve,
the author, Kosters maintains, intended to make the
leaders representative of the twelve tribes and the
body of returned exiles as equivalent to All-Israel.
But, he argues, neither Haggai nor Zechariah considers
the builders of the Temple to be equivalent
to All-Israel, nor was this conception realised in
Judah till after the arrival of Ezra with his bands.
The force of this argument is greatly weakened by
remembering how natural it would have been for men,
who felt the Return under Cyrus, however small,
to be the fulfilment of the Second Isaiah’s glorious
predictions of a restoration of All-Israel, to appoint
twelve leaders, and so make them representative of
the nation as a whole. Kosters’ argument against the
naturalness of such an appointment in 537, and therefore
against the truth of the statement of the List
about it, falls to the ground.</p>

<p>But in the Books of Haggai and Zechariah Dr. Kosters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
finds much more formidable witnesses for his thesis
that there was no Return of exiles from Babylon before
the building of the Temple under Darius. These books
nowhere speak of a Return under Cyrus, nor do they call
the community who built the Temple by the names of
Gôlah or B’ne ha-Gôlah, <i>Captivity</i> or
<i>Sons of the Captivity</i>,
which are given after the Return of Ezra’s bands; but
they simply name them <i>this people</i><a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> or
<i>remnant of the
people</i>,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> <i>people of the land</i>,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> <i>Judah</i>
or <i>House of Judah</i>,<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
names perfectly suitable to Jews who had never left
the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Even if we except
from this list the phrase <i>the remnant of the people</i>, as
intended by Haggai and Zechariah in the numerical
sense of <i>the rest</i> or <i>all the others</i>,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
we have still to deal
with the other titles, with the absence from them of any
symptom descriptive of return from exile, and with
the whole silence of our two prophets concerning such
a return. These are very striking phenomena, and
they undoubtedly afford considerable evidence for Dr.
Kosters’ thesis.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> But it cannot escape notice that the
evidence they afford is mainly negative, and this raises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
two questions: (1) Can the phenomena in Haggai and
Zechariah be accounted for? and (2) whether accounted
for or not, can they be held to prevail against the
mass of positive evidence in favour of a Return under
Cyrus?</p>

<p>An explanation of the absence of all allusion in
Haggai and Zechariah to the Return is certainly
possible.</p>

<p>No one can fail to be struck with the spirituality of
the teaching of Haggai and Zechariah. Their one
ambition is to put courage from God into the poor hearts
before them, that these out of their own resources
may rebuild their Temple. As Zechariah puts it,
<i>Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith
Jehovah of Hosts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> It is obvious why men of this
temper should refrain from appealing to the Return, or to
the royal power of Persia by which it had been achieved.
We can understand why, while the annals employed
in the Book of Ezra record the appeal of the political
leaders of the Jews to Darius upon the strength of the
edict of Cyrus, the prophets, in their effort to encourage
the people to make the most of what they themselves
were and to enforce the omnipotence of God’s Spirit
apart from all human aids, should be silent about
the latter. We must also remember that Haggai and
Zechariah were addressing a people to whom (whatever
view we take of the transactions under Cyrus)
the favour of Cyrus had been one vast disillusion in
the light of the predictions of Second Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Persian magnate Sheshbazzar himself, invested with
full power, had been unable to build the Temple for
them, and had apparently disappeared from Judah,
leaving his powers as Peḥah, or governor, to Zerubbabel.
Was it not, then, as suitable to these circumstances,
as it was essential to the prophets’ own religious
temper, that Haggai and Zechariah should refrain from
alluding to any of the political advantages, to which
their countrymen had hitherto trusted in vain?<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>Another fact should be marked. If Haggai is silent
about any return from exile in the past, he is equally
silent about any in the future. If for him no return
had yet taken place, would he not have been likely to
predict it as certain to happen?<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> At least his silence
on the subject proves how absolutely he confined his
thoughts to the circumstances before him, and to the
needs of his people at the moment he addressed them.
Kosters, indeed, alleges that Zechariah describes the
Return from Exile as still future—viz. in the lyric
piece appended to his Third Vision.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> But, as we shall
see when we come to it, this lyric piece is most probably
an intrusion among the Visions, and is not to
be assigned to Zechariah himself. Even, however, if it
were from the same date and author as the Visions, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
would not prove that no return from Babylon had taken
place, but only that numbers of Jews still remained in
Babylon.</p>

<p>But we may now take a further step. If there were
these natural reasons for the silence of Haggai and
Zechariah about a return of exiles under Cyrus, can
that silence be allowed to prevail against the mass of
testimony which we have that such a return took
place? It is true that, while the Books of Haggai and
Zechariah are contemporary with the period in question,
some of the evidence for the Return, Ezra i. and iii.—iv. 7,
is at least two centuries later, and upon the date of the
rest, the List in Ezra ii. and the Aramaic document in
Ezra iv. 8 ff., we have no certain information. But that
the List is from a date very soon after Cyrus is allowed
by a large number of the most advanced critics,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> and even
if we ignore it, we still have the Aramaic document,
which agrees with Haggai and Zechariah in assigning the
real, effectual beginning of the Temple-building to the
second year of Darius and to the leadership of Zerubbabel
and Jeshua at the instigation of the two prophets.
May we not trust the same document in its relation
of the main facts concerning Cyrus? Again, in his
memoirs Ezra<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> speaks of the transgressions of the
Gôlah or B’ne ha-Gôlah in effecting marriages with
the mixed people of the land, in a way which shows
that he means by the name, not the Jews who had
just come up with himself from Babylon, but the older
community whom he found in Judah, and who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
had time, as his own bands had not, to scatter over the
land and enter into social relations with the heathen.</p>

<p>But, as Kuenen points out,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> we have yet further
evidence for the probability of a Return under Cyrus,
in the explicit predictions of the Second Isaiah that
Cyrus would be the builder of Jerusalem and the
Temple. “If they express the expectation, nourished
by the prophet and his contemporaries, then it is clear
from their preservation for future generations that
Cyrus did not disappoint the hope of the exiles, from
whose midst this voice pealed forth to him.” And this
leads to other considerations. Whether was it more
probable for the poverty-stricken <i>people of the land</i>, the
dregs which Nebuchadrezzar had left behind, or for
the body and flower of Israel in Babylon, to rebuild
the Temple? Surely for the latter.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Among them had
risen, as Cyrus drew near to Babylon, the hopes and
the motives, nay, the glorious assurance of the Return
and the Rebuilding; and with them was all the
material for the latter. Is it credible that they took no
advantage of their opportunity under Cyrus? Is it
credible that they waited nearly a century before
seeking to return to Jerusalem, and that the building
of the Temple was left to people who were half-heathen,
and, in the eyes of the exiles, despicable and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
unholy? This would be credible only upon one
condition, that Cyrus and his immediate successors
disappointed the predictions of the Second Isaiah and
refused to allow the exiles to leave Babylon. But the
little we know of these Persian monarchs points all
the other way: nothing is more probable, for nothing is
more in harmony with Persian policy, than that Cyrus
should permit the captives of the Babylon which he
conquered to return to their own lands.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, we have another, and to the mind of the
present writer an almost conclusive argument, that the
Jews addressed by Haggai and Zechariah were Jews
returned from Babylon. Neither prophet ever charges
his people with idolatry; neither prophet so much as
mentions idols. This is natural if the congregation
addressed was composed of such pious and ardent
adherents of Jehovah, as His word had brought back
to Judah, when His servant Cyrus opened the way. But
had Haggai and Zechariah been addressing <i>the people
of the land</i>, who had never left the land, they could not
have helped speaking of idolatry.</p>

<p>Such considerations may very justly be used against
an argument which seeks to prove that the narratives
of a Return under Cyrus were due to the pious
invention of a Jewish writer who wished to record
that the predictions of the Second Isaiah were fulfilled
by Cyrus, their designated trustee.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> They certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
possess a far higher degree of probability than that
argument does.</p>

<p>Finally there is this consideration. If there was no
return from Babylon under Cyrus, and the Temple, as
Dr. Kosters alleges, was built by the poor people of the
land, is it likely that the latter should have been regarded
with such contempt as they were by the exiles
who returned under Ezra and Nehemiah? Theirs
would then have been the glory of reconstituting Israel,
and their position very different from what we find it.</p>

<p>On all these grounds, therefore, we must hold that
the attempt to discredit the tradition of an important
return of exiles under Cyrus has not been successful;
that such a return remains the more probable solution
of an obscure and difficult problem; and that therefore
the Jews who with Zerubbabel and Jeshua are represented
in Haggai and Zechariah as building the
Temple in the second year of Darius, 520, had come
up from Babylon about 537.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Such a conclusion, of
course, need not commit us to the various data offered
by the Chronicler in his story of the Return, such as
the Edict of Cyrus, nor to all of his details.</p>

<p>2. Many, however, who grant the correctness of the
tradition that a large number of Jewish exiles returned
under Cyrus to Jerusalem, deny the statement of the
Compiler of the Book of Ezra that the returned exiles
immediately prepared to build the Temple and laid
the foundation-stone with solemn festival, but were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
hindered from proceeding with the building till the
second year of Darius.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> They maintain that this late
narrative is contradicted by the contemporary statements
of Haggai and Zechariah, who, according to
them, imply that no foundation-stone was laid till
520 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> For the interpretation of our prophets this
is not a question of cardinal importance. But for
clearness’ sake we do well to lay it open.</p>

<p>We may at once concede that in Haggai and
Zechariah there is nothing which necessarily implies
that the Jews had made any beginning to build the
Temple before the start recorded by Haggai in the
year 520. The one passage, Haggai ii. 18, which is
cited to prove this<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> is at the best ambiguous, and
many scholars claim it as a fixture of that date for
the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of 520.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> At
the same time, and even granting that the latter
interpretation of Haggai ii. 18 is correct, there is
nothing in either Haggai or Zechariah to make it
impossible that a foundation-stone had been laid some
years before, but abandoned in consequence of the
Samaritan obstruction, as alleged in Ezra iii. 8–11.
If we keep in mind Haggai’s and Zechariah’s silence
about the Return from Babylon, and their very natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
concentration upon their own circumstances,<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> we shall
not be able to reckon their silence about previous
attempts to build the Temple as a conclusive proof
that these attempts never took place. Moreover the
Aramaic document, which agrees with our two prophets
in assigning the only effective start of the work on
the Temple to 520,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> does not deem it inconsistent with
this to record that the Persian Satrap of the West of
the Euphrates<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> reported to Darius that, when he asked
the Jews why they were rebuilding the Temple, they
replied not only that a decree of Cyrus had granted
them permission,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> but that his legate Sheshbazzar had
actually laid the foundation-stone upon his arrival at
Jerusalem, and that the building had gone on without
interruption from that time to 520.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> This last assertion,
which of course was false, may have been due either
to a misunderstanding of the Jewish elders by the
reporting Satrap, or else to the Jews themselves,
anxious to make their case as strong as possible.
The latter is the more probable alternative. As even
Stade admits, it was a very natural assertion for the
Jews to make, and so conceal that their effort of 520
was due to the instigation of their own prophets. But
in any case the Aramaic document corroborates the
statement of the Compiler that there was a foundation-stone
laid in the early years of Cyrus, and does not
conceive this to be inconsistent with its own narrative
of a stone being laid in 520, and an effective start at
last made upon the Temple works. So much does
Stade feel the force of this, that he concedes not only
that Sheshbazzar may have started some preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
for building the Temple, but that he may even have
laid the stone with ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>And indeed, is it not in itself very probable that
some early attempt was made by the exiles returned
under Cyrus to rebuild the house of Jehovah? Cyrus
had been predicted by the Second Isaiah not only
as the redeemer of God’s people, but with equal explicitness
as the builder of the Temple; and all the
argument which Kuenen draws from the Second Isaiah
for the fact of the Return from Babylon<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> tells with
almost equal force for the fact of some efforts to
raise the fallen sanctuary of Israel immediately after
the Return. Among the returned were many priests,
and many no doubt of the most sanguine spirits in
Israel. They came straight from the heart of Jewry,
though that heart was in Babylon; they came with the
impetus and obligation of the great Deliverance upon
them; they were the representatives of a community
which we know to have been comparatively wealthy.
Is it credible that they should not have begun the
Temple at the earliest possible moment?</p>

<p>Nor is the story of their frustration by the Samaritans
any less natural.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> It is true that there were not any
adversaries likely to dispute with the colonists the
land in the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem.
The Edomites had overrun the fruitful country about
Hebron, and part of the Shephelah. The Samaritans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
held the rich valleys of Ephraim, and probably the
plain of Ajalon. But if any peasants struggled with
the stony plateaus of Benjamin and Northern Judah,
such must have been of the remnants of the Jewish
population who were left behind by Nebuchadrezzar, and
who clung to the sacred soil from habit or from motives
of religion. Jerusalem was never a site to attract men,
either for agriculture, or, now that its shrine was
desolate and its population scattered, for the command
of trade.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The returned exiles must have been at first
undisturbed by the envy of their neighbours. The
tale is, therefore, probable which attributes the hostility
of the latter to purely religious causes—the refusal of
the Jews to allow the half-heathen Samaritans to
share in the construction of the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Now the
Samaritans could prevent the building. While stones
were to be had by the builders in profusion from the
ruins of the city and the great quarry to the north of
it, ordinary timber did not grow in their neighbourhood,
and though the story be true that a contract was already
made with Phœnicians to bring cedar to Joppa, it had
to be carried thence for thirty-six miles. Here, then,
was the opportunity of the Samaritans. They could
obstruct the carriage both of the ordinary timber and
of the cedar. To this state of affairs the present
writer found an analogy in 1891 among the Circassian
colonies settled by the Turkish Government a few years
earlier in the vicinity of Gerasa and Rabbath-Ammon.
The colonists had built their houses from the numerous
ruins of these cities, but at Rabbath-Ammon they said
their great difficulty had been about timber. And we
could well understand how the Beduin, who resented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the settlement of Circassians on lands they had used
for ages, and with whom the Circassians were nearly
always at variance,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> did what they could to make the
carriage of timber impossible. Similarly with the Jews
and their Samaritan adversaries. The site might be
cleared and the stone of the Temple laid, but if the
timber was stopped there was little use in raising
the walls, and the Jews, further discouraged by the
failure of their impetuous hopes of what the Return
would bring them, found cause for desisting from their
efforts. Bad seasons followed, the labours for their
own sustenance exhausted their strength, and in the
sordid toil their hearts grew hard to higher interests.
Cyrus died in 529, and his legate Sheshbazzar, having
done nothing but lay the stone, appears to have left
Judæa.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> Cambyses marched more than once through
Palestine, and his army garrisoned Gaza, but he was
not a monarch to have any consideration for Jewish
ambitions. Therefore—although Samaritan opposition
ceased on the stoppage of the Temple works and
the Jews procured timber enough for their private
dwellings<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>—is it wonderful that the site of the Temple
should be neglected and the stone laid by Sheshbazzar
forgotten, or that the disappointed Jews should seek
to explain the disillusions of the Return, by arguing
that God’s time for the restoration of His house had
not yet come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
The death of a cruel monarch is always in the East
an occasion for the revival of shattered hopes, and the
events which accompanied the suicide of Cambyses in
522 were particularly fraught with the possibilities of
political change. Cambyses’ throne had been usurped
by one Gaumata, who pretended to be Smerdis or
Barada, a son of Cyrus. In a few months Gaumata
was slain by a conspiracy of seven Persian nobles, of
whom Darius, the son of Hystaspes, both by virtue of
his royal descent and by his own great ability, was
raised to the throne in 521. The empire had been
too profoundly shocked by the revolt of Gaumata to
settle at once under the new king, and Darius found
himself engaged by insurrections in all his provinces
except Syria and Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> The colonists in Jerusalem,
like all their Syrian neighbours, remained loyal
to the new king; so loyal that their Peḥah or Satrap
was allowed to be one of themselves—Zerubbabel, son
of She’altî’el,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> a son of their royal house. Yet though
they were quiet, the nations were rising against each
other and the world was shaken. It was just such
a crisis as had often before in Israel rewakened
prophecy. Nor did it fail now; and when prophecy
was roused what duty lay more clamant for its inspiration
than the duty of building the Temple?</p>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF HAGGAI</p>

<p class="noindent">The Book of Haggai contains thirty-eight verses,
which have been divided between two chapters.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
The text is, for the prophets, a comparatively sound
one. The Greek version affords a number of corrections,
but has also the usual amount of misunderstandings,
and, as in the case of other prophets, a few
additions to the Hebrew text.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> These and the variations
in the other ancient versions will be noted in the
translation below.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>The book consists of four sections, each recounting
a message from Jehovah to the Jews in Jerusalem in
520 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, <i>the second year of Darius</i> (Hystaspis),
<i>by the hand of the prophet Haggai</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i>, chap. i., dated the first day of the sixth
month, during our September, reproves the Jews for
building their own <i>cieled houses</i>, while they say that
<i>the time for building Jehovah’s house has not yet come</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
affirms that this is the reason of their poverty and
of a great drought which has afflicted them. A piece
of narrative is added recounting how Zerubbabel and
Jeshua, the heads of the community, were stirred by
this word to lead the people to begin work on the
Temple, on the twenty-fourth day of the same month.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> section, chap. ii. 1–9, contains a message,
dated the twenty-first day of the seventh month, during
our October, in which the builders are encouraged for
their work. Jehovah is about to shake all nations,
these shall contribute of their wealth, and the latter
glory of the Temple be greater than the former.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> section, chap. ii. 10–19, contains a word
of Jehovah which came to Haggai on the twenty-fourth
day of the ninth month, during our December. It is
in the form of a parable based on certain ceremonial
laws, according to which the touch of a holy thing does
not sanctify so much as the touch of an unholy pollutes.
Thus is the people polluted, and thus every work of
their hands. Their sacrifices avail nought, and adversity
has persisted: small increase of fruits, blasting,
mildew and hail. But from this day God will bless.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> section, chap. ii. 20–23, is a second word
from the Lord to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of
the ninth month. It is for Zerubbabel, and declares
that God will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and
destroy the forces of many of the Gentiles by war.
In that day Zerubbabel, the Lord’s elect servant, shall
be as a signet to the Lord.</p>

<p>The authenticity of all these four sections was
doubted by no one,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> till ten years ago W. Böhme,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
besides pointing out some useless repetitions of single
words and phrases, cast suspicion on chap. i. 13, and questioned
the whole of the <i>fourth</i> section, chap. ii. 20–23.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
With regard to chap. i. 13, it is indeed curious that
Haggai should be described as <i>the messenger of Jehovah</i>;
while the message itself, <i>I am with you</i>, seems superfluous
here, and if the verse be omitted, ver.&nbsp;14 runs
on naturally to ver.&nbsp;12.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> Böhme’s reasons for disputing
the authenticity of chap. ii. 20–23 are much less
sufficient. He thinks he sees the hand of an editor
in the phrase <i>for a second time</i> in ver.&nbsp;20; notes the
omission of the title “prophet”<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> after Haggai’s name,
and the difference of the formula <i>the word came to
Haggai</i> from that employed in the previous sections, <i>by
the hand of Haggai</i>, and the repetition of ver.&nbsp;6<i>b</i> in
ver.&nbsp;21; and otherwise concludes that the section is an
insertion from a later hand. But the formula <i>the word
came to Haggai</i> occurs also in ii. 10:<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> the other points
are trivial, and while it was most natural for Haggai
the contemporary of Zerubbabel to entertain of the
latter such hopes as the passage expresses, it is inconceivable
that a later writer, who knew how they
had not been fulfilled in Zerubbabel, should have
invented them.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>Recently M. Tony Andrée, <i>privat-docent</i> in the University
of Geneva, has issued a large work on Haggai,<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> in
which he has sought to prove that the <i>third</i> section of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the book, chap. ii. (10) 11–19, is from the hand of
another writer than the rest. He admits<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> that in
neither form, nor style, nor language is there anything
to prove this distinction, and that the ideas of all the
sections suit perfectly the condition of the Jews in the
time soon after the Return. But he considers that
chap. ii. (10) 11–19 interrupts the connection between
the sections upon either side of it; that the author
is a legalist or casuist, while the author of the other
sections is a man whose only ecclesiastical interest is
the rebuilding of the Temple; that there are obvious
contradictions between chap. ii. (10) 11–19 and the rest
of the book; and that there is a difference of vocabulary.
Let us consider each of these reasons.</p>

<p>The first, that chap. ii. (10) 11–19 interrupts the connection
between the sections on either side of it, is true
only in so far as it has a different subject from that
which the latter have more or less in common. But
the second of the latter, chap. ii. 20–23, treats only of
a corollary of the first, chap. ii. 1–9, and that corollary
may well have formed the subject of a separate oracle.
Besides, as we shall see, chap. ii. 10–19 is a natural
development of chap. i.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> The contradictions alleged by
M. Andrée are two. He points out that while chap. i.
speaks only of a <i>drought</i>,<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> chap. ii. (10) 11–19 mentions<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
as the plagues on the crops shiddāphôn and yērākôn,
generally rendered <i>blasting</i> and <i>mildew</i> in our English
Bible, and bārād, or <i>hail</i>; and these he reckons to be
plagues due not to drought but to excessive moisture.
But shiddāphôn and yērākôn, which are always connected
in the Old Testament and are words of doubtful meaning,
are not referred to damp in any of the passages in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
which they occur, but, on the contrary, appear to be
the consequences of drought.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> The other contradiction
alleged refers to the ambiguous verse ii. 18, on which we
have already seen it difficult to base any conclusion, and
which will be treated when we come to it in the course
of translation.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Finally, the differences in language
which M. Andrée cites are largely imaginary, and it
is hard to understand how a responsible critic has
come to cite, far more to emphasise them, as he has
done. We may relegate the discussion of them to a
note,<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> and need here only remark that there is among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
them but one of any significance: while the rest of the
book calls the Temple <i>the House</i> or <i>the House of
Jehovah</i> (or <i>of Jehovah of Hosts</i>), chap. ii. (10) 11–19
styles it <i>palace</i>, or temple, of Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> On such a
difference between two comparatively brief passages
it would be unreasonable to decide for a distinction of
authorship.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no reason to disagree with the
consensus of all other critics in the integrity of the
Book of Haggai. The four sections are either from
himself or from a contemporary of his. They probably
represent,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> not the full addresses given by him on the
occasions stated, but abstracts or summaries of these.
“It is never an easy task to persuade a whole population
to make pecuniary sacrifices, or to postpone private
to public interests; and the probability is, that in
these brief remains of the prophet Haggai we have
but one or two specimens of a ceaseless diligence and
persistent determination, which upheld and animated
the whole people till the work was accomplished.”<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
At the same time it must be noticed that the style
of the book is not wholly of the bare, jejune prose
which it is sometimes described to be. The passages
of Haggai’s own exhortation are in the well-known
parallel rhythm of prophetic discourse: see especially
chap. i., ver. <a href="#Page_239">6</a>.</p>

<p>The only other matter of Introduction to the prophet
Haggai is his name. The precise form<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> is not elsewhere
found in the Old Testament; but one of the
clans of the tribe of Gad is called Haggi,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> and the
letters H G I occur as the consonants of a name on
a Phœnician inscription.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Some<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> have taken Haggai to
be a contraction of Haggiyah, the name of a Levitical
family,<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> but although the final <i>yod</i> of some proper
names stands for Jehovah, we cannot certainly conclude
that it is so in this case. Others<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> see in Haggai
a probable contraction for Hagariah,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> as Zaccai, the
original of Zacchæus, is a contraction of Zechariah.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
A more general opinion<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> takes the termination as
adjectival,<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> and the root to be “hag,” <i>feast</i> or <i>festival</i>.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
In that case Haggai would mean <i>festal</i>, and it has been
supposed that the name would be given to him from
his birth on the day of some feast. It is impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
to decide with certainty among these alternatives.
M. Andrée,<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> who accepts the meaning <i>festal</i>, ventures
the hypothesis that, like “Malachi,” Haggai is a symbolic
title given by a later hand to the anonymous writer
of the book, because of the coincidence of his various
prophecies with solemn festivals.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> But the name is
too often and too naturally introduced into the book
to present any analogy to that of “Malachi”; and
the hypothesis may be dismissed as improbable and
unnatural.</p>

<p>Nothing more is known of Haggai than his name
and the facts given in his book. But as with the
other prophets whom we have treated, so with this
one, Jewish and Christian legends have been very
busy. Other functions have been ascribed to him;
a sketch of his biography has been invented. According
to the Rabbis he was one of the men of the Great
Synagogue, and with Zechariah and “Malachi” transmitted
to that mythical body the tradition of the older
prophets.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> He was the author of several ceremonial
regulations, and with Zechariah and “Malachi” introduced
into the alphabet the terminal forms of the five
elongated letters.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> The Christian Fathers narrate that
he was of the tribe of Levi,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> that with Zechariah he
prophesied in exile of the Return,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> and was still young
when he arrived in Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> where he died and was
buried. A strange legend, founded on the doubtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
verse which styles him <i>the messenger of Jehovah</i>,
gave out that Haggai, as well as for similar reasons
“Malachi” and John the Baptist, were not men, but
angels in human shape.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> With Zechariah Haggai
appears on the titles of Psalms cxxxvii., cxlv.-cxlviii.
in the Septuagint; cxi., cxlv., cxlvi. in the Vulgate; and
cxxv., cxxvi. and cxlv.-cxlviii. in the Peshitto.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> “In
the Temple at Jerusalem he was the first who chanted
the Hallelujah, ... wherefore we say: Hallelujah,
which is the hymn of Haggai and Zechariah.”<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> All
these testimonies are, of course, devoid of value.</p>

<p>Finally, the modern inference from chap. ii. 3, that
Haggai in his youth had seen the former Temple, had
gone into exile, and was now returned a very old
man,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> may be probable, but is not certain. We are
quite ignorant of his age at the time the word of
Jehovah came to him.</p>

<p class="captitle">HAGGAI AND THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</p>

<p class="csubtitle">H<span class="small">AGGAI</span> i., ii.</p>

<p class="noindent">We have seen that the most probable solution of
the problems presented to us by the inadequate
and confused records of the time is that a considerable
number of Jewish exiles returned from Jerusalem
to Babylon about 537, upon the permission of Cyrus,
and that the Satrap whom he sent with them not only
allowed them to raise the altar on its ancient site,
but himself laid for them the foundation-stone of the
Temple.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>We have seen, too, why this attempt led to nothing,
and we have followed the Samaritan obstructions, the
failure of the Persian patronage, the drought and
bad harvests, and all the disillusion of the fifteen
years which succeeded the Return.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The hostility of
the Samaritans was entirely due to the refusal of the
Jews to give them a share in the construction of the
Temple, and its virulence, probably shown by preventing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the Jews from procuring timber, seems to have ceased
when the Temple works were stopped. At least we
find no mention of it in our prophets; and the Jews
are furnished with enough of timber to panel and ciel
their own houses.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> But the Jews must have feared
a renewal of Samaritan attacks if they resumed work
on the Temple, and for the rest they were too sodden
with adversity, and too weighted with the care of their
own sustenance, to spring at higher interests. What
immediately precedes our prophets is a miserable story
of barren seasons and little income, money leaking fast
away, and every man’s sordid heart engrossed with his
own household. Little wonder that critics have been
led to deny the great Return of sixteen years back,
with its grand ambitions for the Temple and glorious
future of Israel. But the like collapse has often been
experienced in history when bands of religious men,
going forth, as they thought, to freedom and the
immediate erection of a holy commonwealth, have found
their unity wrecked and their enthusiasm dissipated by
a few inclement seasons on a barren and a hostile
shore. Nature and their barbarous fellow-men have
frustrated what God had promised. Themselves,
accustomed from a high stage of civilisation to plan
still higher social structures, are suddenly reduced to
the primitive necessities of tillage and defence against
a savage foe. Statesmen, poets and idealists of sorts
have to hoe the ground, quarry stones and stay up of
nights to watch as sentinels. Destitute of the comforts
and resources with which they have grown up, they live
in constant battle with their bare and unsympathetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
environs. It is a familiar tale in history, and we read
it with ease in the case of Israel. The Jews enjoyed
this advantage, that they came not to a strange land,
but to one crowded with inspiring memories, and they
had behind them the most glorious impetus of prophecy
which ever sent a people forward to the future. Yet
the very ardours of this hurried them past a due
appreciation of the difficulties they would have to
encounter, and when they found themselves on the
stony soil of Judah, which they had been idealising
for fifty years, and were further afflicted by barren
seasons, their hearts must have suffered an even more
bitter disillusion than has so frequently fallen to the
lot of religious emigrants to an absolutely new coast.</p>

<p>It was to this situation, upon an autumn day, when
the colonists felt another year of beggarly effort behind
them and their wretched harvest had been brought
home, that the prophet Haggai addressed himself.
With rare sense he confined his efforts to the practical
needs of the moment. The sneers of modern writers
have not been spared upon a style that is crabbed and
jejune, and they have esteemed this to be a collapse
of the prophetic spirit, in which Haggai ignored
all the achievements of prophecy and interpreted the
word of God as only a call to hew wood and lay
stone upon stone. But the man felt what the moment
needed, and that is the supreme mark of the prophet.
Set a prophet there, and what else could a prophet
have done? It would have been futile to rewaken
those most splendid voices of the past, which had in
part been the reason of the people’s disappointment,
and equally futile to interpret the mission of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
world powers towards God’s people. What God’s
people themselves could do for themselves—that was
what needed telling at the moment; and if Haggai
told it with a meagre and starved style, this also was
in harmony with the occasion. One does not expect
it otherwise when hungry men speak to each other
of their duty.</p>

<p>Nor does Haggai deserve blame that he interpreted
the duty as the material building of the Temple.
This was no mere ecclesiastical function. Without
the Temple the continuity of Israel’s religion could
not be maintained. An independent state, with the
full courses of civic life, was then impossible. The
ethical spirit, the regard for each other and God, could
prevail over their material interests in no other way
than by common devotion to the worship of the God
of their fathers. In urging them to build the Temple
from their own unaided resources, in abstaining from
all hopes of imperial patronage, in making the business
one, not of sentiment nor of comfortable assurance
derived from the past promises of God, but of plain
and hard duty—Haggai illustrated at once the sanity
and the spiritual essence of prophecy in Israel.</p>

<p>Professor Robertson Smith has contrasted the central
importance which Haggai attached to the Temple with
the attitude of Isaiah and Jeremiah, to whom “the
religion of Israel and the holiness of Jerusalem have
little to do with the edifice of the Temple. The city
is holy because it is the seat of Jehovah’s sovereignty
on earth, exerted in His dealings with and for the state
of Judah and the kingdom of David.”<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> At the same
time it ought to be pointed out that even to Isaiah the
Temple was the dwelling-place of Jehovah, and if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
had been lying in ruins at his feet, as it was at Haggai’s,
there is little doubt he would have been as earnest as
Haggai in urging its reconstruction. Nor did the
Second Isaiah, who has as lofty an idea of the spiritual
destiny of the people as any other prophet, lay less
emphasis upon the cardinal importance of the Temple
to their life, and upon the certainty of its future glory.</p>

<p><i>In the second year of Darius<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> the king, in the sixth

<p><i>Thus hath Jehovah of Hosts spoken, saying: This
people have said, Not yet<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> is come the time for the building
of Jehovah’s House. Therefore Jehovah’s word is come
by Haggai the prophet, saying: Is it a time for you—you<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>—to

this House is waste? And now thus saith Jehovah of
Hosts: Lay to heart how things have gone with you.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Ye

sowed much but had little income, ate and were not
satisfied, drank and were not full, put on clothing and
there was no warmth, while he that earned wages has
earned them into a bag with holes.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Go up into the
mountain</i>—the hill-country of Judah—<i>and bring in
timber, and build the House, that I may take pleasure
in it, and show My glory, saith Jehovah. Ye looked for
much and it has turned out little,<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> and what ye brought
home I puffed at. On account of what?—oracle of
Jehovah of Hosts—on account of My House which
is waste, while ye are hurrying every man after his
own house. Therefore<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> hath heaven shut off the dew,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
and earth shut off her increase. And I have called
drought upon the earth, both upon the mountains,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> and
upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and
upon what the ground brings forth, and upon man,
and upon beast, and upon all the labour of the hands.</i></p>

<p>For ourselves, Haggai’s appeal to the barren seasons
and poverty of the people as proof of God’s anger with
their selfishness must raise questions. But we have
already seen, not only that natural calamities were by
the ancient world interpreted as the penal instruments
of the Deity, but that all through history they have
had a wonderful influence on the spirits of men, forcing
them to search their own hearts and to believe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Providence is conducted for other ends than those of
our physical prosperity. “Have not those who have
believed as Amos believed ever been the strong spirits
of our race, making the very disasters which crushed
them to the earth the tokens that God has great views
about them?”<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Haggai, therefore, takes no sordid
view of Providence when he interprets the seasons,
from which his countrymen had suffered, as God’s
anger upon their selfishness and delay in building His
House.</p>

<p>The straight appeal to the conscience of the Jews
had an immediate effect. Within three weeks they
began work on the Temple.</p>

<p><i>And Zerubbabel, son of She’altî’el, and Jehoshua’, son
of Jehoṣadaḳ, the high priest, and all the rest of the people,
hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and to the
words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had
sent him; and the people feared before the face of Jehovah.
[And Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, in Jehovah’s
mission to the people, spake, saying, I am with you—oracle
of Jehovah.]<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> And Jehovah stirred the spirit of
Zerubbabel, son of She’altî’el, Satrap of Judah, and the
spirit of Jehoshua’, son of Jehoṣadaḳ, the high priest, and
the spirit of all the rest of the people; and they went and
did work in the House of Jehovah of Hosts, their God, on
the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second
year of Darius the king.</i><a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>Note how the narrative emphasises that the new
energy was, as it could not but be from Haggai’s
unflattering words, a purely spiritual result. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the <i>spirit</i> of Zerubbabel, and the <i>spirit</i> of Jehoshua,
and the <i>spirit</i> of all the rest of the people, which was
stirred—their conscience and radical force of character.
Not in vain had the people suffered their great disillusion
under Cyrus, if now their history was to start
again from sources so inward and so pure.</p>

<p>The second occasion on which Haggai spoke to the
people was another feast the same autumn, the seventh
day of the Feast of Tabernacles,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> the twenty-first of
the seventh month. For nearly four weeks the work
on the Temple had proceeded. Some progress must
have been made, for comparisons became possible
between the old Temple and the state of this one.
Probably the outline and size of the building were
visible. In any case it was enough to discourage the
builders with their efforts and the means at their disposal.
Haggai’s new word is a very simple one of
encouragement. The people’s conscience had been
stirred by his first; they needed now some hope. Consequently
he appeals to what he had ignored before,
the political possibilities which the present state of
the world afforded—always a source of prophetic
promise. But again he makes his former call upon
their own courage and resources. The Hebrew text
contains a reference to the Exodus which would be
appropriate to a discourse delivered during the Feast
of Tabernacles, but it is not found in the Septuagint,
and is so impossible to construe that it has been justly
suspected as a gloss, inserted by some later hand, only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
because the passage had to do with the Feast of
Tabernacles.</p>

Jehovah of Hosts. Mine is the silver and Mine the gold—oracle

of Hosts, and in this place will I give peace<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>—oracle
of Jehovah of Hosts.</i></p>

<p>From the earliest times this passage, by the
majority of the Christian Church, has been interpreted
of the coming of Christ. The Vulgate renders
ver.&nbsp;7<i>b</i>, <i>Et veniet Desideratus cunctis gentibus</i>, and so
a large number of the Latin Fathers, who are followed
by Luther, <i>Der Trost aller Heiden</i>, and by our own
Authorised Version, <i>And the Desire of all nations shall
come</i>. This was not contrary to Jewish tradition, for
Rabbi Akiba had defined the clause of the Messiah,
and Jerome received the interpretation from his Jewish
instructors. In itself the noun, as pointed in the
Massoretic text, means <i>longing</i> or <i>object of longing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
But the verb which goes with it is in the plural, and
by a change of points the noun itself may be read as
a plural.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> That this was the original reading is made
extremely probable by the fact that it lay before the
translators of the Septuagint, who render: <i>the picked</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
or <i>chosen, things of the nations</i>.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> So the old Italic
version: <i>Et venient omnia electa gentium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> Moreover
this meaning suits the context, as the other does
not. The next verse mentions silver and gold. “We
may understand what he says,” writes Calvin, “of
Christ; we indeed know that Christ was the expectation

follows, <i>Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold</i>, the
more simple meaning is that which I first stated: that
the nations would come, bringing with them all their
riches, that they might offer themselves and all their
possessions a sacrifice to God.”<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>Haggai’s third address to the people is based on a
deliverance which he seeks from the priests. The
Book of Deuteronomy had provided that, in all difficult
cases not settled by its own code, the people shall
seek a <i>deliverance</i> or <i>Torah</i> from the priests, <i>and shall
observe to do according to the deliverance which the priests
deliver to thee</i>.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Both noun and verb, which may be
thus literally translated, are also used for the completed
and canonical Law in Israel, and they signify
that in the time of the composition of the Book of
Deuteronomy that Law was still regarded as in process
of growth. So it is also in the time of Haggai: he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
does not consult a code of laws, nor asks the priests
what the canon says, as, for instance, our Lord does
with the question, <i>how readest thou</i>? But he begs them
to give him <i>a</i> Torah or <i>deliverance</i>,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> based of course
upon existing custom, but not yet committed to writing.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
For the history of the Law in Israel this is, therefore,
a passage of great interest.</p>

<p><i>On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second
year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Haggai
the prophet, saying: Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, Ask,
I pray, of the priests a deliverance,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> saying:—</i></p>

<p><i>If a man be carrying flesh that is holy in the skirt of
his robe, and with his skirt touch bread or pottage or wine
or oil or any food, shall </i>the latter<i> become holy? And
the priests gave answer and said, No! And Haggai
said, If one unclean by a corpse<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> touch any of these, shall
</i>the latter<i> become unclean? And the priests gave answer
and said, It shall.</i> That is to say, holiness which
passed from the source to an object immediately in
touch with the latter did not spread further; but
pollution infected not only the person who came into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
contact with it, but whatever he touched.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> “The flesh
of the sacrifice hallowed whatever it should touch, but
not further;<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> but the human being who was defiled by
touching a dead body, defiled all he might touch.”<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>
<i>And Haggai answered and said: So is this people, and
so is this nation before Me—oracle of Jehovah—and so
is all the work of their hands, and what they offer there</i>—at
the altar erected on its old site—<i>is unclean</i>.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> That
is to say, while the Jews had expected their restored
ritual to make them holy to the Lord, this had not
been effective, while, on the contrary, their contact
with sources of pollution had thoroughly polluted both
themselves and their labour and their sacrifices. What
these sources of pollution are is not explicitly stated,
but Haggai, from his other messages, can only mean,
either the people’s want of energy in building the
Temple, or the unbuilt Temple itself. Andrée goes so
far as to compare the latter with the corpse, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
touch, according to the priests, spreads infection through
more than one degree. In any case Haggai means
to illustrate and enforce the building of the Temple
without delay; and meantime he takes one instance of
the effect he has already spoken of, <i>the work of their
hands</i>, and shows how it has been spoilt by their
neglect and delay. <i>And now, I pray, set your hearts
backward from to-day,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> before stone was laid upon stone
in the Temple of Jehovah: ...<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> when one came to a
heap of grain of twenty measures, and it had become
ten, or went to the winevat to draw fifty measures,<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> and
it had become twenty. I smote you with blasting and with
withering,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> and with hail all the work of your hands,
and ...<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>—oracle of Jehovah. Lay now your hearts
</i>on the time<i> before to-day<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> (the twenty-fourth day of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
ninth month<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>), before the day of the foundation of the
Temple of Jehovah<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>—lay your hearts</i> to that time! <i>Is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
there yet</i> any <i>seed in the barn<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>? And as yet<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> the
vine, the fig-tree, the pomegranate and the olive have not
borne</i> fruit. <i>From this day I will bless thee.</i></p>

<p>This then is the substance of the whole message. On
the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, somewhere
in our December, the Jews had been discouraged
that their attempts to build the Temple, begun three
months before,<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> had not turned the tide of their
misfortunes and produced prosperity in their agriculture.
Haggai tells them, there is not yet time for the
change to work. If contact with a holy thing has
only a slight effect, but contact with an unclean thing
has a much greater effect (verses 11–13), then their
attempts to build the Temple must have less good
influence upon their condition than the bad influence of
all their past devotion to themselves and their secular
labours. That is why adversity still continues, but
courage! from this day on God will bless. The whole
message is, therefore, opportune to the date at which
it was delivered, and comes naturally on the back of
Haggai’s previous oracles. Andrée’s reason for assigning
it to another writer, on the ground of its breaking
the connection, does not exist.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>These poor colonists, in their hope deferred, were
learning the old lesson, which humanity finds so hard
to understand, that repentance and new-born zeal do
not immediately work a change upon our material
condition; but the natural consequences of sin often
outweigh the influence of conversion, and though
devoted to God and very industrious we may still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
be punished for a sinful past. Evil has an infectious
power greater than that of holiness. Its effects are
more extensive and lasting.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> It was no bit of casuistry
which Haggai sought to illustrate by his appeal to the
priests on the ceremonial law, but an ethical truth
deeply embedded in human experience.</p>

<p>On the same day Haggai published another oracle,
in which he put the climax to his own message by re-investing
in Zerubbabel the ancient hopes of his people.
When the monarchy fell the Messianic hopes were
naturally no longer concentrated in the person of a king;
and the great evangelist of the Exile found the elect and
anointed Servant of Jehovah in the people as a whole,
or in at least the pious part of them, with functions
not of political government but of moral influence and
instruction towards all the peoples of the earth. Yet
in the Exile Ezekiel still predicted an individual
Messiah, a son of the house of David; only it is significant
that, in his latest prophecies delivered after the
overthrow of Jerusalem, Ezekiel calls him not <i>king</i><a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
any more, but <i>prince</i>.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
After the return of Sheshbazzar to Babylon this
position was virtually filled by Zerubbabel, a grandson
of Jehoiakin, the second last king of Judah, and
appointed by the Persian king Peḥah or Satrap of
Judah. Him Haggai now formally names the elect
servant of Jehovah. In that overturning of the kingdoms
of the world which Haggai had predicted two
months before, and which he now explains as their
mutual destruction by war, Jehovah of Hosts will
make Zerubbabel His signet-ring, inseparable from
Himself and the symbol of His authority.</p>

<p><i>And the word of Jehovah came a second time to<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>
Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the</i> ninth <i>month,
saying: Speak to Zerubbabel, Satrap of Judah, saying:
I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> and I
will overturn the thrones<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> of kingdoms, and will shatter
the power of the kingdoms of the Gentiles, and will overturn
chariots<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> and their riders, and horses and their
riders will come down, every man by the sword of his
brother. In that day—oracle of Jehovah of Hosts—I
will take Zerubbabel, son of She’altî’el, My servant—oracle
of Jehovah—and will make him like a signet-ring;
for thee have I chosen—oracle of Jehovah of Hosts.</i></p>

<p>The wars and mutual destruction of the Gentiles, of
which Haggai speaks, are doubtless those revolts of
races and provinces, which threatened to disrupt the
Persian Empire upon the accession of Darius in 521.
Persians, Babylonians, Medes, Armenians, the Sacæ
and others rose together or in succession. In four
years Darius quelled them all, and reorganised his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
empire before the Jews finished their Temple. Like
all the Syrian governors, Zerubbabel remained his poor
lieutenant and submissive tributary. History rolled
westward into Europe. Greek and Persian began their
struggle for the control of its future, and the Jews fell
into an obscurity and oblivion unbroken for centuries.
The <i>signet-ring of Jehovah</i> was not acknowledged by
the world—does not seem even to have challenged its
briefest attention. But Haggai had at least succeeded in
asserting the Messianic hope of Israel, always baffled,
never quenched, in this re-opening of her life. He had
delivered the ancient heritage of Israel to the care of
the new Judaism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Haggai’s place in the succession of prophecy ought
now to be clear to us. The meagreness of his words
and their crabbed style, his occupation with the construction
of the Temple, his unfulfilled hope in Zerubbabel,
his silence on the great inheritance of truth
delivered by his predecessors, and the absence from
his prophesying of all visions of God’s character and
all emphasis upon the ethical elements of religion—these
have moved some to depress his value as a
prophet almost to the vanishing point. Nothing could
be more unjust. In his opening message Haggai
evinced the first indispensable power of the prophet:
to speak to the situation of the moment, and to succeed
in getting men to take up the duty at their feet;
in another message he announced a great ethical
principle; in his last he conserved the Messianic traditions
of his religion, and though not less disappointed
than Isaiah in the personality to whom he looked for
their fulfilment, he succeeded in passing on their hope
undiminished to future ages.</p>

</div>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF ZECHARIAH (I.—VIII.)</p>


<p class="noindent">The Book of Zechariah, consisting of fourteen
chapters, falls clearly into two divisions: <i>First</i>,
chaps. i.—viii., ascribed to Zechariah himself and
full of evidence for their authenticity; <i>Second</i>,
chaps. ix.—xiv., which are not ascribed to Zechariah,
and deal with conditions different from those upon
which he worked. The full discussion of the date and
character of this second section we shall reserve till we
reach the period at which we believe it to have been
written. Here an introduction is necessary only to
chaps. i.—viii.</p>

<p>These chapters may be divided into five sections.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I. Chap. i. 1–6.—A Word of Jehovah which came to Zechariah in the
eighth month of the second year of Darius, that is in November 520
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, or between the second and the third oracles of Haggai.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> In this
the prophet’s place is affirmed in the succession of the prophets of
Israel. The ancient prophets are gone, but their predictions have
been fulfilled in the calamities of the Exile, and God’s Word abides
for ever.</p>

<p>II. Chap. i. 7—vi. 9.—A Word of Jehovah which came to Zechariah
on the twenty-fourth of the eleventh month of the same year, that
is January or February 519, and which he reproduces in the form of
eight Visions by night. (1) The Vision of the Four Horsemen: God’s
new mercies to Jerusalem (chap. i. 7–17). (2) The Vision of the Four
Horns, or Powers of the World, and the Four Smiths, who smite
them down (ii. 1–4 Heb., but in the Septuagint and in the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Version i. 18–21). (3) The Vision of the Man with the Measuring
Rope: Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, no longer as a narrow fortress, but
spread abroad for the multitude of her population (chap. ii. 5–9 Heb.,
ii. 1–5 LXX. and Eng.). To this Vision is appended a lyric piece
of probably older date calling upon the Jews in Babylon to return,
and celebrating the joining of many peoples to Jehovah, now that
He takes up again His habitation in Jerusalem (chap. ii. 10–17 Heb.,
ii. 6–13 LXX. and Eng.). (4) The Vision of Joshua, the High Priest,
and the Satan or Accuser: the Satan is rebuked, and Joshua is
cleansed from his foul garments and clothed with a new turban and
festal apparel; the land is purged and secure (chap. iii.). (5) The
Vision of the Seven-Branched Lamp and the Two Olive-Trees
(chap. iv. 1–6<i>a</i>, 10<i>b</i>-14): into the centre of this has been inserted
a Word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel (vv. 6<i>b</i>-10<i>a</i>), which interrupts
the Vision and ought probably to come at the close of it. (6) The
Vision of the Flying Book: it is the curse of the land, which is being
removed, but after destroying the houses of the wicked (chap. v. 1–4).
(7) The Vision of the Bushel and the Woman: that is the guilt of
the land and its wickedness; they are carried off and planted in the
land of Shinar (v. 5–11). (8) The Vision of the Four Chariots: they
go forth from the Lord of all the earth, to traverse the earth and
bring His Spirit, or anger, to bear on the North country (chap. vi. 1–8).</p>

<p>III. Chap. vi. 9–15.—A Word of Jehovah, undated (unless it is to
be taken as of the same date as the Visions to which it is attached),
giving directions as to the gifts sent to the community at Jerusalem
from the Babylonian Jews. A crown is to be made from the silver
and gold, and, according to the text, placed upon the head of Joshua.
But, as we shall see,<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> the text gives evident signs of having been
altered in the interest of the High Priest; and probably the crown
was meant for Zerubbabel, at whose right hand the priest is to stand,
and there shall be a counsel of peace between the two of them. The
far-away shall come and assist at the building of the Temple. This
section breaks off in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>IV. Chap. vii.—The Word of Jehovah which came to Zechariah on
the fourth of the ninth month of the fourth year of Darius, that is
nearly two years after the date of the Visions. The Temple was
approaching completion; and an inquiry was addressed to the priests
who were in it and to the prophets concerning the Fasts, which
had been maintained during the Exile, while the Temple lay desolate
(chap. vii. 1–3). This inquiry drew from Zechariah a historical
explanation of how the Fasts arose (chap. vii. 4–14).</p>

<p>V. Chap. viii.—Ten short undated oracles, each introduced by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the same formula, <i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts</i>, and summarising all
Zechariah’s teaching since before the Temple began up to the question
of the cessation of the Fasts upon its completion—with promises
for the future. (1) A Word affirming Jehovah’s new zeal for
Jerusalem and His Return to her (vv. 1, 2). (2) Another of the
same (ver.&nbsp;3). (3) A Word promising fulness of old folk and
children in her streets (vv. 4, 5). (4) A Word affirming that
nothing is too wonderful for Jehovah (ver.&nbsp;6). (5) A Word promising
the return of the people from east and west (vv. 7, 8).
(6 and 7) Two Words contrasting, in terms similar to Haggai i., the
poverty of the people before the foundation of the Temple with their
new prosperity: from a curse Israel shall become a blessing. This
is due to God’s anger having changed into a purpose of grace to
Jerusalem. But the people themselves must do truth and justice,
ceasing from perjury and thoughts of evil against each other
(vv. 9–17). (8) A Word which recurs to the question of Fasting,
and commands that the four great Fasts, instituted to commemorate
the siege and overthrow of Jerusalem, and the murder of Gedaliah,
be changed to joy and gladness (vv. 18, 19). (9) A Word predicting
the coming of the Gentiles to the worship of Jehovah at
Jerusalem (vv. 20–22). (10) Another of the same (ver.&nbsp;23).</p></div>

<p>There can be little doubt that, apart from the few
interpolations noted, these eight chapters are genuine
prophecies of Zechariah, who is mentioned in the Book
of Ezra as the colleague of Haggai, and contemporary
of Zerubbabel and Joshua at the time of the rebuilding
of the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Like the oracles of Haggai, these
prophecies are dated according to the years of Darius
the king, from his second year to his fourth. Although
they may contain some of the exhortations to
build the Temple, which the Book of Ezra informs us
that Zechariah made along with Haggai, the most of
them presuppose progress in the work, and seek
to assist it by historical retrospect and by glowing
hopes of the Messianic effects of its completion. Their
allusions suit exactly the years to which they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
assigned. Darius is king. The Exile has lasted about
seventy years.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Numbers of Jews remain in Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>

steady and orderly progress throughout the prophecies,
in harmony with the successive dates at which they
were delivered. In November 520 they begin with a
cry to repentance and lessons drawn from the past of
prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> In January 519 Temple and City are still

that the priests are said to belong to it;<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> there is no

Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>These features leave no room for doubt that the
great bulk of the first eight chapters of the Book
of Zechariah are by the prophet himself, and from the
years to which he assigns them, November 520 to
December 518. The point requires no argument.</p>

<p>There are, however, three passages which provoke
further examination—two of them because of the signs
they bear of an earlier date, and one because of the
alteration it has suffered in the interests of a later day
in Israel’s history.</p>

<p>The lyric passage which is appended to the Second
Vision (chap. ii 10–17 Heb., 6–13 LXX. and Eng.)
suggests questions by its singularity: there is no other
such among the Visions. But in addition to this it
speaks not only of the Return from Babylon as still
future<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>—this might still be said after the First Return
of the exiles in 536<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>—but it differs from the language
of all the Visions proper in describing the return of
Jehovah Himself to Zion as still future. The whole,
too, has the ring of the great odes in Isaiah xl.—lv.,
and seems to reflect the same situation, upon the eve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon. There can be little
doubt that we have here inserted in Zechariah’s Visions
a song of twenty years earlier, but we must confess
inability to decide whether it was adopted by Zechariah
himself or added by a later hand.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>Again, there are the two passages called the Word
of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, chap. iv. 6<i>b</i>-10<i>a</i>; and the
Word of Jehovah concerning the gifts which came to
Jerusalem from the Jews in Babylon, chap. vi. 9–15.
The first, as Wellhausen has shown,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> is clearly out of
place; it disturbs the narrative of the Vision, and is to
be put at the end of the latter. The second is undated,
and separate from the Visions. The second plainly
affirms that the building of the Temple is still future.
The man whose name is Branch or Shoot is designated:
<i>and he shall build the Temple of Jehovah</i>. The first is
in the same temper as the first two oracles of Haggai.
It is possible then that these two passages are not,
like the Visions with which they are taken, to be
dated from 519, but represent that still earlier prophesying
of Zechariah with which we are told he
assisted Haggai in instigating the people to begin to
build the Temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The style of the prophet Zechariah betrays special
features almost only in the narrative of the Visions.
Outside these his language is simple, direct and pure,
as it could not but be, considering how much of it is
drawn from, or modelled upon, the older prophets,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
and chiefly Hosea and Jeremiah. Only one or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
lapses into a careless and degenerate dialect show us
how the prophet might have written, had he not been
sustained by the music of the classical periods of the
language.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>This directness and pith is not shared by the
language in which the Visions are narrated.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Here the
style is involved and redundant. The syntax is loose;
there is a frequent omission of the copula, and of other
means by which, in better Hebrew, connection and
conciseness are sustained. The formulas, <i>thus saith</i>
and <i>saying</i>, are repeated to weariness. At the same
time it is fair to ask, how much of this redundancy
was due to Zechariah himself? Take the Septuagint
version. The Hebrew text, which it followed, not only
included a number of repetitions of the formulas, and
of the designations of the personages introduced into
the Visions, which do not occur in the Massoretic text,<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
but omitted some which are found in the Massoretic
text.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> These two sets of phenomena prove that from
an early date the copiers of the original text of Zechariah
must have been busy in increasing its redundancies.
Further, there are still earlier intrusions and expansions,
for these are shared by both the Hebrew and
the Greek texts: some of them very natural efforts to
clear up the personages and conversations recorded in
the dreams,<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> some of them stupid mistakes in understanding
the drift of the argument.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> There must of
course have been a certain amount of redundancy in
the original to provoke such aggravations of it, and of
obscurity or tortuousness of style to cause them to be
deemed necessary. But it would be very unjust to
charge all the faults of our present text to Zechariah
himself, especially when we find such force and simplicity
in the passages outside the Visions. Of course
the involved and misty subjects of the latter naturally
forced upon the description of them a laboriousness
of art, to which there was no provocation in directly
exhorting the people to a pure life, or in straightforward
predictions of the Messianic era.</p>

<p>Beyond the corruptions due to these causes, the text
of Zechariah i.—viii. has not suffered more than that
of our other prophets. There are one or two clerical
errors;<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> an occasional preposition or person of a verb
needs to be amended. Here and there the text has
been disarranged;<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and as already noticed, there has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
been one serious alteration of the original.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>From the foregoing paragraphs it must be apparent
what help and hindrance in the reconstruction of the
text is furnished by the Septuagint. A list of its variant
readings and of its mistranslations is appended.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p class="captitle">ZECHARIAH THE PROPHET</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">ECHARIAH</span> i. 1–6, etc.;
     E<span class="small">ZRA</span> v. 1, vi. 14</p>

<p class="noindent">Zechariah is one of the prophets whose personality
as distinguished from their message exerts
some degree of fascination on the student. This is not
due, however, as in the case of Hosea or Jeremiah,
to the facts of his life, for of these we know extremely
little; but to certain conflicting symptoms of character
which appear through his prophecies.</p>

<p>His name was a very common one in Israel, Zekher-Yah,
<i>Jehovah remembers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> In his own book he is
described as <i>the son of Berekh-Yah, the son of Iddo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> and
in the Aramaic document of the Book of Ezra as <i>the
son of Iddo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Some have explained this difference by
supposing that Berekhyah was the actual father of the
prophet, but that either he died early, leaving Zechariah
to the care of the grandfather, or else that he was a
man of no note, and Iddo was more naturally mentioned
as the head of the family. There are several instances
in the Old Testament of men being called the sons of
their grandfathers:<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> as in these cases the grandfather
was the reputed founder of the house, so in that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Zechariah Iddo was the head of his family when it
came out of Babylon and was anew planted in Jerusalem.
Others, however, have contested the genuineness
of the words <i>son of Berekh-Yah</i>, and have traced their
insertion to a confusion of the prophet with Zechariah
son of Yĕbherekh-Yahu, the contemporary of Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
This is precarious, while the other hypothesis is a
very natural one.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Whichever be correct, the prophet
Zechariah was a member of the priestly family of Iddo,
that came up to Jerusalem from Babylon under Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
The Book of Nehemiah adds that in the high-priesthood
of Yoyakim, the son of Joshua, the head of the house
of Iddo was a Zechariah.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> If this be our prophet, then
he was probably a young man in 520,<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> and had come
up as a child in the caravans from Babylon. The
Aramaic document of the Book of Ezra<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> assigns to
Zechariah a share with Haggai in the work of instigating
Zerubbabel and Jeshua to begin the Temple. None
of his oracles is dated previous to the beginning of the
work in August 520, but we have seen<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> that among
those undated there are one or two which by referring
to the building of the Temple as still future may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
contain some relics of that first stage of his ministry.
From November 520 we have the first of his dated
oracles; his Visions followed in January 519, and his
last recorded prophesying in December 518.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>These are all the certain events of Zechariah’s
history. But in the well-attested prophecies he has
left we discover, besides some obvious traits of character,
certain problems of style and expression which
suggest a personality of more than usual interest.
Loyalty to the great voices of old, the temper which
appeals to the experience, rather than to the dogmas,
of the past, the gift of plain speech to his own times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
a wistful anxiety about his reception as a prophet<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
combined with the absence of all ambition to be
original or anything but the clear voice of the lessons
of the past and of the conscience of to-day—these are
the qualities which characterise Zechariah’s orations
to the people. But how to reconcile them with the
strained art and obscure truths of the Visions—it is
this which invests with interest the study of his
personality. We have proved that the obscurity and
redundancy of the Visions cannot all have been due
to himself. Later hands have exaggerated the repetitions
and ravelled the processes of the original. But
these gradual blemishes have not grown from nothing:
the original style must have been sufficiently involved
to provoke the interpolations of the scribes, and it
certainly contained all the weird and shifting apparitions
which we find so hard to make clear to ourselves.
The problem, therefore, remains—how one who had
gift of speech, so straight and clear, came to torture
and tangle his style; how one who presented with all
plainness the main issues of his people’s history found
it laid upon him to invent, for the further expression
of these, symbols so laboured and intricate.</p>

<p>We begin with the oracle, which opens his book and
illustrates those simple characteristics of the man that
contrast so sharply with the temper of his Visions.</p>

<p><i>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the
word of Jehovah came to the prophet Zechariah, son of
Berekhyah, son of Iddo,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> saying: Jehovah was very
wroth<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> with your fathers. And thou shalt say unto them:
Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Turn ye to Me—oracle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Jehovah of Hosts—that I may turn to you, saith Jehovah
of Hosts! Be not like your fathers, to whom the former
prophets preached, saying: “Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
Turn now from your evil ways and from<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> your evil
deeds,” but they hearkened not, and paid no attention to
Me—oracle of Jehovah. Your fathers, where are they?
And the prophets, do they live for ever? But<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> My words
and My statutes, with which I charged My servants the
prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? till these
turned and said, As Jehovah of Hosts did purpose to do
unto us, according to our deeds and according to our
ways, so hath He dealt with us.</i></p>

<p>It is a sign of the new age which we have reached,
that its prophet should appeal to the older prophets
with as much solemnity as they did to Moses himself.
The history which led to the Exile has become to Israel
as classic and sacred as her great days of deliverance
from Egypt and of conquest in Canaan. But still
more significant is what Zechariah seeks from that
past; this we must carefully discover, if we would
appreciate with exactness his rank as a prophet.</p>

<p>The development of religion may be said to consist
of a struggle between two tempers, both of which
indeed appeal to the past, but from very opposite
motives. The one proves its devotion to the older
prophets by adopting the exact formulas of their doctrine,
counts these sacred to the letter, and would enforce
them in detail upon the minds and circumstances
of the new generation. It conceives that truth has
been promulgated once for all in forms as enduring
as the principles they contain. It fences ancient rites,
cherishes old customs and institutions, and when these
are questioned it becomes alarmed and even savage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
The other temper is no whit behind this one in its
devotion to the past, but it seeks the ancient prophets
not so much for what they have said as for what they
have been, not for what they enforced but for what
they encountered, suffered and confessed. It asks not
for dogmas but for experience and testimony. He
who can thus read the past and interpret it to his own
day—he is the prophet. In his reading he finds nothing
so clear, nothing so tragic, nothing so convincing as
the working of the Word of God. He beholds how
this came to men, haunted them and was entreated by
them. He sees that it was their great opportunity,
which being rejected became their judgment. He finds
abused justice vindicated, proud wrong punished, and
all God’s neglected commonplaces achieving in time
their triumph. He reads how men came to see this, and
to confess their guilt. He is haunted by the remorse
of generations who know how they might have obeyed
the Divine call, but wilfully did not. And though they
have perished, and the prophets have died and their
formulas are no more applicable, the victorious Word
itself still lives and cries to men with the terrible
emphasis of their fathers’ experience. All this is the
vision of the true prophet, and it was the vision of
Zechariah.</p>

<p>His generation was one whose chief temptation was
to adopt towards the past the other attitude we have
described. In their feebleness what could the poor
remnant of Israel do but cling servilely to the former
greatness? The vindication of the Exile had stamped
the Divine authority of the earlier prophets. The
habits, which the life in Babylon had perfected, of
arranging and codifying the literature of the past, and
of employing it, in place of altar and ritual, in the
stated service of God, had canonised Scripture and
provoked men to the worship of its very letter. Had
the real prophet not again been raised, these habits
might have too early produced the belief that the
Word of God was exhausted, and must have fastened
upon the feeble life of Israel that mass of stiff and
stark dogmas, the literal application of which Christ
afterwards found crushing the liberty and the force of
religion. Zechariah prevented this—for a time. He
himself was mighty in the Scriptures of the past: no
man in Israel makes larger use of them. But he
employs them as witnesses, not as dogmas; he finds
in them not authority, but experience.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> He reads their
testimony to the ever-living presence of God’s Word
with men. And seeing that, though the old forms and
figures have perished with the hearts which shaped
them, the Word itself in its bare truth has vindicated
its life by fulfilment in history, he knows that it lives
still, and hurls it upon his people, not in the forms
published by this or that prophet of long ago, but in
its essence and direct from God Himself, as His Word
for to-day and now. <i>The fathers, where are they?
And the prophets, do they live for ever? But My words
and My statutes, with which I charged My servants the
prophets, have they not overtaken your fathers? Thus
saith Jehovah of Hosts, Be ye not like your fathers, but
turn ye to Me that I may turn to you.</i></p>

<p>The argument of this oracle might very naturally
have been narrowed into a credential for the prophet
himself as sent from God. About his reception as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Jehovah’s messenger Zechariah shows a repeated
anxiety. Four times he concludes a prediction with
the words, <i>And ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent
me</i>,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> as if after his first utterances he had encountered
that suspicion and unbelief which a prophet never
failed to suffer from his contemporaries. But in this
oracle there is no trace of such personal anxiety.
The oracle is pervaded only with the desire to prove
the ancient Word of God as still alive, and to drive
it home in its own sheer force. Like the greatest of
his order, Zechariah appears with the call to repent:
<i>Turn ye to Me—oracle of Jehovah of Hosts—that I may
turn to you</i>. This is the pivot on which history has
turned, the one condition on which God has been able
to help men. Wherever it is read as the conclusion
of all the past, wherever it is proclaimed as the conscience
of the present, there the true prophet is found
and the Word of God has been spoken.</p>

<p>The same possession by the ethical spirit reappears,
as we shall see, in Zechariah’s orations to the people
after the anxieties of building are over and the completion
of the Temple is in sight. In these he affirms
again that the whole essence of God’s Word by the
older prophets has been moral—to judge true judgment,
to practise mercy, to defend the widow and orphan, the
stranger and poor, and to think no evil of one another.
For the sad fasts of the Exile Zechariah enjoins gladness,
with the duty of truth and the hope of peace. Again
and again he enforces sincerity and the love without
dissimulation. His ideals for Jerusalem are very high,
including the conversion of the nations to her God.
But warlike ambitions have vanished from them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
his pictures of her future condition are homely and
practical. Jerusalem shall be no more a fortress, but
spread village-wise without walls.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Full families, unlike
the present colony with its few children and its men
worn out in middle life by harassing warfare with
enemies and a sullen nature; streets rife with children
playing and old folk sitting in the sun; the return of
the exiles; happy harvests and springtimes of peace;
solid gain of labour for every man, with no raiding
neighbours to harass, nor the mutual envies of peasants
in their selfish struggle with famine.</p>

<p>It is a simple, hearty, practical man whom such
prophesying reveals, the spirit of him bent on justice
and love, and yearning for the unharassed labour of
the field and for happy homes. No prophet has more
beautiful sympathies, a more direct word of righteousness,
or a braver heart. <i>Fast not, but love truth and
peace. Truth and wholesome justice set ye up in your
gates. Be not afraid; strengthen your hands! Old
men and women shall yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem,
each with staff in hand for the fulness of their years; the
city’s streets shall be rife with boys and girls at play.</i></p>

<p class="captitle">THE VISIONS OF ZECHARIAH</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">ECHARIAH</span> i. 7—vi.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Visions of Zechariah do not lack those large
and simple views of religion which we have
just seen to be the charm of his other prophecies.
Indeed it is among the Visions that we find the most
spiritual of all his utterances:<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> <i>Not by might, and not
by force, but by My Spirit, saith Jehovah of Hosts</i>. The
Visions express the need of the Divine forgiveness,
emphasise the reality of sin, as a principle deeper than
the civic crimes in which it is manifested, and declare
the power of God to banish it from His people. The
Visions also contain the remarkable prospect of Jerusalem
as the City of Peace, her only wall the Lord Himself.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>
The overthrow of the heathen empires is predicted
by the Lord’s own hand, and from all the Visions there
are absent both the turmoil and the glory of war.</p>

<p>We must also be struck by the absence of another
element, which is a cause of complexity in the writings
of many prophets—the polemic against idolatry.
Zechariah nowhere mentions the idols. We have
already seen what proof this silence bears for the fact
that the community to which he spoke was not that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
half-heathen remnant of Israel which had remained in
the land, but was composed of worshippers of Jehovah
who at His word had returned from Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Here
we have only to do with the bearing of the fact upon
Zechariah’s style. That bewildering confusion of the
heathen pantheon and its rites, which forms so much
of our difficulty in interpreting some of the prophecies
of Ezekiel and the closing chapters of the Book of
Isaiah, is not to blame for any of the complexity of
Zechariah’s Visions.</p>

<p>Nor can we attribute the latter to the fact that the
Visions are dreams, and therefore bound to be more
involved and obscure than the words of Jehovah which
came to Zechariah in the open daylight of his people’s
public life. In chaps. i. 7—vi. we have not the narrative
of actual dreams, but a series of conscious and
artistic allegories—the deliberate translation into a
carefully constructed symbolism of the Divine truths
with which the prophet was entrusted by his God.
Yet this only increases our problem—why a man with
such gifts of direct speech, and such clear views of
his people’s character and history, should choose to
express the latter by an imagery so artificial and
involved? In his orations Zechariah is very like the
prophets whom we have known before the Exile,
thoroughly ethical and intent upon the public conscience
of his time. He appreciates what they were, feels
himself standing in their succession, and is endowed
both with their spirit and their style. But none of
them constructs the elaborate allegories which he does,
or insists upon the religious symbolism which he enforces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
as indispensable to the standing of Israel with God.
Not only are their visions few and simple, but they
look down upon the visionary temper as a rude stage
of prophecy and inferior to their own, in which the
Word of God is received by personal communion with
Himself, and conveyed to His people by straight and
plain words. Some of the earlier prophets even condemn
all priesthood and ritual; none of them regards
these as indispensable to Israel’s right relations with
Jehovah; and none employs those superhuman
mediators of the Divine truth, by whom Zechariah
is instructed in his Visions.</p>

<h4 id="XXIsec1">1.T<span class="small">HE</span>
  I<span class="small">NFLUENCES WHICH</span>
   M<span class="small">OULDED THE</span>
   V<span class="small">ISIONS</span>.</h4>

<p>The explanation of this change that has come over
prophecy must be sought for in certain habits which
the people formed in exile. During the Exile several
causes conspired to develop among Hebrew writers
the tempers both of symbolism and apocalypse. The
chief of these was their separation from the realities of
civic life, with the opportunity their political leisure
afforded them of brooding and dreaming. Facts and
Divine promises, which had previously to be dealt with
by the conscience of the moment, were left to be worked
out by the imagination. The exiles were not responsible
citizens or statesmen, but dreamers. They were
inspired by mighty hopes for the future, and not
fettered by the practical necessities of a definite
historical situation upon which these hopes had to be
immediately realised. They had a far-off horizon to
build upon, and they occupied the whole breadth of it.
They had a long time to build, and they elaborated the
minutest details of their architecture. Consequently
their construction of the future of Israel, and their
description of the processes by which it was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
reached, became colossal, ornate and lavishly symbolic.
Nor could the exiles fail to receive stimulus for all this
from the rich imagery of Babylonian art by which they
were surrounded.</p>

<p>Under these influences there were three strong
developments in Israel. One was that development of
Apocalypse the first beginnings of which we traced in
Zephaniah—the representation of God’s providence of
the world and of His people, not by the ordinary
political and military processes of history, but by awful
convulsions and catastrophes, both in nature and in
politics, in which God Himself appeared, either alone
in sudden glory or by the mediation of heavenly
armies. The second—and it was but a part of the
first—was the development of a belief in Angels:
superhuman beings who had not only a part to play
in the apocalyptic wars and revolutions; but, in the
growing sense, which characterises the period, of God’s
distance and awfulness, were believed to act as His
agents in the communication of His Word to men.
And, thirdly, there was the development of the Ritual.
To some minds this may appear the strangest of all
the effects of the Exile. The fall of the Temple, its
hierarchy and sacrifices, might be supposed to enforce
more spiritual conceptions of God and of His communion
with His people. And no doubt it did. The impossibility
of the legal sacrifices in exile opened the mind
of Israel to the belief that God was satisfied with the
sacrifices of the broken heart, and drew near, without
mediation, to all who were humble and pure of heart.
But no one in Israel therefore understood that these
sacrifices were for ever abolished. Their interruption
was regarded as merely temporary even by the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
spiritual of Jewish writers. The Fifty-First Psalm, for
instance, which declares that <i>the sacrifices of God are
a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O Lord,
Thou wilt not despise</i>, immediately follows this declaration
by the assurance that <i>when God builds again the
walls of Jerusalem</i>, He will once more take delight in
<i>the legal sacrifices: burnt offering and whole burnt
offering, the oblation of bullocks upon Thine altar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> For
men of such views the ruin of the Temple was not its
abolition with the whole dispensation which it represented,
but rather the occasion for its reconstruction
upon wider lines and a more detailed system, for the
planning of which the nation’s exile afforded the leisure
and the carefulness of art described above. The ancient
liturgy, too, was insufficient for the stronger convictions
of guilt and need of purgation, which sore
punishment had impressed upon the people. Then,
scattered among the heathen as they were, they learned
to require stricter laws and more drastic ceremonies
to restore and preserve their holiness. Their ritual,
therefore, had to be expanded and detailed to a degree
far beyond what we find in Israel’s earlier systems of
worship. With the fall of the monarchy and the
absence of civic life the importance of the priesthood
was proportionately enhanced; and the growing sense
of God’s aloofness from the world, already alluded to,
made the more indispensable human, as well as superhuman,
mediators between Himself and His people.
Consider these things, and it will be clear why prophecy,
which with Amos had begun a war against all ritual,
and with Jeremiah had achieved a religion absolutely
independent of priesthood and Temple, should reappear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
after the Exile, insistent upon the building of the
Temple, enforcing the need both of priesthood and
sacrifice, and while it proclaimed the Messianic King
and the High Priest as the great feeders of the national
life and worship, finding no place beside them for the
Prophet himself.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>The force of these developments of Apocalypse,
Angelology and the Ritual appears both in Ezekiel
and in the exilic codification of the ritual which forms
so large a part of the Pentateuch. Ezekiel carries
Apocalypse far beyond the beginnings started by
Zephaniah. He introduces, though not under the
name of angels, superhuman mediators between himself
and God. The Priestly Code does not mention angels,
and has no Apocalypse; but like Ezekiel it develops,
to an extraordinary degree, the ritual of Israel. Both
its author and Ezekiel base on the older forms, but
build as men who are not confined by the lines of an
actually existing system. The changes they make,
the innovations they introduce, are too numerous to
mention here. To illustrate their influence upon
Zechariah, it is enough to emphasise the large place
they give in the ritual to the processes of propitiation
and cleansing from sin, and the increased authority
with which they invest the priesthood. In Ezekiel
Israel has still a Prince, though he is not called King.
He arranges the cultus,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> and sacrifices are offered for
him and the people,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> but the priests teach and judge
the people.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> In the Priestly Code<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> the priesthood is
more rigorously fenced than by Ezekiel from the laity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
and more regularly graded. At its head appears a
High Priest (as he does not in Ezekiel), and by his
side the civil rulers are portrayed in lesser dignity and
power. Sacrifices are made, no longer as with Ezekiel
for Prince and People, but for Aaron and the Congregation;
and throughout the narrative of ancient
history, into the form of which this Code projects its
legislation, the High Priest stands above the captain of
the host, even when the latter is Joshua himself. God’s
enemies are defeated not so much by the wisdom and
valour of the secular powers, as by the miracles of
Jehovah Himself, mediated through the priesthood.
Ezekiel and the Priestly Code both elaborate the
sacrifices of atonement and sanctification beyond all
the earlier uses.</p>

   F<span class="small">EATURES OF THE</span>
   V<span class="small">ISIONS</span>.</h4>

<p>It was beneath these influences that Zechariah grew
up, and to them we may trace, not only numerous
details of his Visions, but the whole of their involved
symbolism. He was himself a priest and the son of
a priest, born and bred in the very order to which we
owe the codification of the ritual, and the development
of those ideas of guilt and uncleanness that
led to its expansion and specialisation. The Visions
in which he deals with these are the Third to the
Seventh. As with Haggai there is a High Priest, in
advance upon Ezekiel and in agreement with the Priestly
Code. As in the latter the High Priest represents the
people, and carries their guilt before God.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> He and
his colleagues are pledges and portents of the coming
Messiah. But the civil power is not yet diminished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
before the sacerdotal, as in the Priestly Code. We
shall find indeed that a remarkable attempt has been
made to alter the original text of a prophecy appended
to the Visions,<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> in order to divert to the High Priest
the coronation and Messianic rank there described.
But any one who reads the passage carefully can see
for himself that the crown (a single crown, as the
verb which it governs proves<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>) which Zechariah was
ordered to make was designed for Another than the
priest, that the priest was but to stand at this Other’s
right hand, and that there was to be concord between
the two of them. This Other can only have been the
Messianic King, Zerubbabel, as was already proclaimed
by Haggai.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> The altered text is due to a later period,
when the High Priest became the civil as well as the
religious head of the community. To Zechariah he
was still only the right hand of the monarch in government;
but, as we have seen, the religious life of the
people was already gathered up and concentrated in
him. It is the priests, too, who by their perpetual
service and holy life bring on the Messianic era.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
Men come to the Temple to propitiate Jehovah, for
which Zechariah uses the anthropomorphic expression
<i>to make smooth</i> or <i>placid His face</i>.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> No more than this
is made of the sacrificial system, which was not in full
course when the Visions were announced. But the
symbolism of the Fourth Vision is drawn from the
furniture of the Temple. It is interesting that the great
candelabrum seen by the prophet should be like, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the ten lights of the old Temple of Solomon, but the
seven-branched candlestick described in the Priestly
Code. In the Sixth and Seventh Visions, the strong
convictions of guilt and uncleanness, which were engendered
in Israel by the Exile, are not removed by the
sacrificial means enforced in the Priestly Code, but by
symbolic processes in the style of the visions of Ezekiel.</p>

<p>The Visions in which Zechariah treats of the outer
history of the world are the first two and the last, and
in these we notice the influence of the Apocalypse
developed during the Exile. In Zechariah’s day Israel
had no stage for their history save the site of Jerusalem
and its immediate neighbourhood. So long as he keeps
to this Zechariah is as practical and matter-of-fact as
any of the prophets, but when he has to go beyond it
to describe the general overthrow of the heathen, he is
unable to project that, as Amos or Isaiah did, in terms
of historic battle, and has to call in the apocalyptic. A
people such as that poor colony of exiles, with no issue
upon history, is forced to take refuge in Apocalypse,
and carries with it even those of its prophets whose
conscience, like Zechariah’s, is most strongly bent upon
the practical present. Consequently these three historical
Visions are the most vague of the eight. They
reveal the whole earth under the care of Jehovah and
the patrol of His angels. They definitely predict the
overthrow of the heathen empires. But, unlike Amos
or Isaiah, the prophet does not see by what political
movements this is to be effected. The world <i>is</i> still
<i>quiet and at peace</i>.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> The time is hidden in the Divine
counsels; the means, though clearly symbolised in <i>four
smiths</i> who come forward to smite the horns of the
heathen,<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> and in a chariot which carries God’s wrath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to the North,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> are obscure. The prophet appears to
have intended, not any definite individuals or political
movements of the immediate future, but God’s own
supernatural forces. In other words, the Smiths and
Chariots are not an allegory of history, but powers
apocalyptic. The forms of the symbols were derived
by Zechariah from different sources. Perhaps that of
the <i>smiths</i> who destroy the horns in the Second Vision
was suggested by the <i>smiths of destruction</i> threatened
upon Ammon by Ezekiel.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> In the horsemen of the
First Vision and the chariots of the Eighth, Ewald
sees a reflection of the couriers and posts which Darius
organised throughout the empire; they are more probably,
as we shall see, a reflection of the military
bands and patrols of the Persians. But from whatever
quarter Zechariah derived the exact aspect of these
Divine messengers, he found many precedents for them
in the native beliefs of Israel. They are, in short,
angels, incarnate as Hebrew angels always were, and
in fashion like men. But this brings up the whole
subject of the angels, whom he also sees employed
as the mediators of God’s Word to him; and that
is large enough to be left to a chapter by itself.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>We have now before us all the influences which led
Zechariah to the main form and chief features of his
Visions.</p>

<p>For all the Visions there is one date, <i>in the twenty-fourth

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
year of Darius</i>, that is January or February 519; and
one Divine impulse, <i>the Word of Jehovah came to the

<p>The seventy years which Jeremiah had fixed for the
duration of the Babylonian servitude were drawing
to a close. Four months had elapsed since Haggai
promised that in a little while God would shake all
nations.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> But the world was not shaken: there was
no political movement which promised to restore her
glory to Jerusalem. A very natural disappointment
must have been the result among the Jews. In this
situation of affairs the Word came to Zechariah, and
both situation and Word he expressed by his First
Vision.</p>

<p>It was one of the myrtle-covered glens in the neighbourhood
of Jerusalem:<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Zechariah calls it <i>the</i> Glen
or Valley-Bottom, either because it was known under
that name to the Jews, or because he was himself wont
to frequent it for prayer. He discovers in it what
seems to be a rendezvous of Persian cavalry-scouts,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>
the leader of the troop in front, and the rest behind
him, having just come in with their reports. Soon,
however, he is made aware that they are angels, and
with that quick, dissolving change both of function
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
and figure, which marks all angelic apparitions,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> they
explain to him their mission. Now it is an angel-interpreter
at his side who speaks, and now the angel
on the front horse. They are scouts of God come in
from their survey of the whole earth. The world lies
quiet. Whereupon <i>the angel of Jehovah</i> asks Him how
long His anger must rest on Jerusalem and nothing
be done to restore her; and the prophet hears a kind
and comforting answer. The nations have done more
evil to Israel than God empowered them to do. Their
aggravations have changed His wrath against her to
pity, and in pity He is come back to her. She shall
soon be rebuilt and overflow with prosperity.</p>

<p>The only perplexity in all this is the angels’ report
that the whole earth lies quiet. How this could have
been in 519 is difficult to understand. The great
revolts against Darius were then in active progress, the
result was uncertain and he took at least three more
years to put them all down. They were confined, it
is true, to the east and north-east of the empire, but
some of them threatened Babylon, and we can hardly
ascribe the report of the angels to such a limitation of
the Jews’ horizon at this time as shut out Mesopotamia
or the lands to the north of her. There remain two
alternatives. Either these far-away revolts made only
more impressive the stagnancy of the tribes of the rest
of the empire, and the helplessness of the Jews and
their Syrian neighbours was convincingly shown by
their inability to take advantage even of the desperate
straits to which Darius was reduced; or else in that
month of vision Darius had quelled one of the rebellions
against him, and for the moment there was quiet in
the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
<i>By night I had a vision, and behold! a man riding a
brown horse,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> and he was standing between the myrtles
that are in the Glen;<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and behind him horses brown,
bay<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> and white. And I said, What are these, my lord?
And the angel who talked with me said, I will show you
what these are. And the man who was standing among
the myrtles answered and said, These are they whom
Jehovah hath sent to go to and fro through the earth.
And they answered the angel of Jehovah who stood
among the myrtles,<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> and said, We have gone up and
down through the earth, and lo! the whole earth is still
and at peace.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> And the angel of Jehovah answered and
said, Jehovah of Hosts, how long hast Thou no pity for
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Thou hast
been wroth these seventy years? And Jehovah answered
the angel who talked with me,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> kind words and comforting.
And the angel who talked with me said to me, Proclaim
now as follows: Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, I am
zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion, with a great zeal;
but with great wrath am I wroth against the arrogant
Gentiles. For I was but a little angry</i> with Israel, <i>but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
they aggravated the evil.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah,
I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house
shall be built in her—oracle of Jehovah of Hosts—and the
measuring line shall be drawn over Jerusalem. Proclaim
yet again, saying: Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, My
cities shall yet overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall
again comfort Zion, and again make choice of Jerusalem.</i></p>

<p>Two things are to be noted in this oracle. No
political movement is indicated as the means of Jerusalem’s
restoration: this is to be the effect of God’s free
grace in returning to dwell in Jerusalem, which is the
reward of the building of the Temple. And there is
an interesting explanation of the motive for God’s new
grace: in executing His sentence upon Israel, the
heathen had far exceeded their commission, and now
themselves deserved punishment. That is to say, the
restoration of Jerusalem and the resumption of the
worship are not enough for the future of Israel. The
heathen must be chastised. But Zechariah does not
predict any overthrow of the world’s power, either by
earthly or by heavenly forces. This is entirely in
harmony with the insistence upon peace which distinguishes
him from other prophets.</p>

<p>The Second Vision supplies what is lacking in the
First, the destruction of the tyrants who have oppressed
Israel. The prophet sees four horns, which, he is told
by his interpreting angel, are the powers that have
scattered Judah. The many attempts to identify these
with four heathen nations are ingenious but futile.</p>

“<i>Four</i> horns were seen as representing the totality of
Israel’s enemies—her enemies from all quarters.”<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> And
to destroy these horns four smiths appear. Because in
the Vision the horns are of iron, in Israel an old symbol
of power, the first verb used of the action can hardly
be, as in the Hebrew text, to terrify. The Greek reads
<i>sharpen</i>, and probably some verb meaning <i>to cut</i> or
<i>chisel</i> stood in the original.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>Like the Second Vision, the Third follows from the
First, another, but a still more significant, supplement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
The First had promised the rebuilding of Jerusalem,
and now the prophet beholds <i>a young man</i>—by this
term he probably means <i>a servant</i> or <i>apprentice</i>—who
is attempting to define the limits of the new city.
In the light of what this attempt encounters, there can
be little doubt that the prophet means to symbolise by
it the intention of building the walls upon the old lines,
so as to make Jerusalem again the mountain fortress
she had previously been. Some have considered that
the young man goes forth only to see, or to show,
the extent of the city in the approaching future. But
if this had been his motive, there would have been no
reason in interrupting him with other orders. The
point is, that he has narrow ideas of what the city
should be, and is prepared to define it upon its old
lines of a fortress. For the interpreting angel who
<i>comes forward</i><a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> is told by another angel to run and
tell the young man that in the future Jerusalem shall be
a large unwalled town, and this, not only because of
the multitude of its population, for even then it might
still have been fortified like Niniveh, but because
Jehovah Himself shall be its wall. The young man
is prevented, not merely from making it small, but
from making it a citadel. And this is in conformity
with all the singular absence of war from Zechariah’s
Visions, both of the future deliverance of Jehovah’s
people and of their future duties before Him. It is
indeed remarkable how Zechariah not only develops
none of the warlike elements of earlier Messianic prophecies,
but tells us here of how God Himself actually
prevented their repetition, and insists again and again
only on those elements of ancient prediction which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
filled the future of Israel with peace.</p>

<p><i>And I lifted mine eyes and looked, and lo! a man
with a measuring rope in his hand. So I said, Whither
art thou going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem:
to see how much its breadth and how much its
length should be. And lo! the angel who talked with
me came forward,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> and another angel came forward to
meet him. And he said to him, Run and speak to yonder
young man thus:</i> Like <i>a number of open villages shall
Jerusalem remain, because of the multitude of men and
cattle in the midst of her. And I Myself will be to her—oracle
of Jehovah—a wall of fire round about, and for
glory will I be in her midst.</i></p>

<p>In this Vision Zechariah gives us, with his prophecy,
a lesson in the interpretation of prophecy. His
contemporaries believed God’s promise to rebuild Jerusalem,
but they defined its limits by the conditions of
an older and a narrower day. They brought forth their
measuring rods, to measure the future by the sacred
attainments of the past. Such literal fulfilment of His
Word God prevented by that ministry of angels which
Zechariah beheld. He would not be bound by those
forms which His Word had assumed in suitableness to
the needs of ruder generations. The ideal of many of
the returned exiles must have been that frowning citadel,
those gates of everlastingness,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> which some of them celebrated
in Psalms, and from which the hosts of Sennacherib
had been broken and swept back as the angry
sea is swept from the fixed line of Canaan’s coast.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>
What had been enough for David and Isaiah was
enough for them, especially as so many prophets of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Lord had foretold a Messianic Jerusalem that should
be a counterpart of the historical. But God breaks the
letter of His Word to give its spirit a more glorious
fulfilment. Jerusalem shall not <i>be builded as a city that
is compact together</i>,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> but open and spread abroad village-wise
upon her high mountains, and God Himself her
only wall.</p>

<p>The interest of this Vision is therefore not only
historical. For ourselves it has an abiding doctrinal
value. It is a lesson in the method of applying
prophecy to the future. How much it is needed we
must feel as we remember the readiness of men among
ourselves to construct the Church of God upon the
lines His own hand drew for our fathers, and to raise
again the bulwarks behind which they sufficiently
sheltered His shrine. Whether these ancient and
sacred defences be dogmas or institutions, we have no
right, God tells us, to cramp behind them His powers
for the future. And the great men whom He raises
to remind us of this, and to prevent by their ministry
the timid measurements of the zealous but servile
spirits who would confine everything to the exact letter
of ancient Scripture—are they any less His angels to
us than those ministering spirits whom Zechariah
beheld preventing the narrow measures of the poor
apprentice of his dream?</p>

<p>To the Third Vision there has been appended the
only lyrical piece which breaks the prose narrative of
the Visions. We have already seen that it is a piece
of earlier date. Israel is addressed as still scattered to
the four winds of heaven, and still inhabiting Babylon.
While in Zechariah’s own oracles and visions Jehovah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
has returned to Jerusalem, His return according to this
piece is still future. There is nothing about the
Temple: God’s holy dwelling from which He has
roused Himself is Heaven. The piece was probably
inserted by Zechariah himself: its lines are broken
by what seems to be a piece of prose, in which the
prophet asserts his mission, in words he twice uses
elsewhere. But this is uncertain.</p>

<p>The next Visions deal with the moral condition of
Israel and their standing before God. The Fourth is
a judgment scene. The Angel of Jehovah, who is not
to be distinguished from Jehovah Himself,<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> stands for
judgment, and there appear before him Joshua the
High Priest and the Satan or Adversary who has
come to accuse him. Now those who are accused by
the Satan—see next chapter of this volume upon the
Angels of the Visions—are, according to Jewish belief,
those who have been overtaken by misfortune. The
people who are standing at God’s bar in the person
of their High Priest still suffer from the adversity
in which Haggai found them, and the continuance of
which so disheartened them after the Temple had
begun. The evil seasons and poor harvests tormented
their hearts with the thought that the Satan still
slandered them in the court of God. But Zechariah
comforts them with the vision of the Satan rebuked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Israel has indeed been sorely beset by calamity, a
brand much burned, but now of God’s grace plucked
from the fire. The Satan’s role is closed, and he
disappears from the Vision.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Yet something remains:
Israel is rescued, but not sanctified. The nation’s
troubles are over: their uncleanness has still to be
removed. Zechariah sees that the High Priest is
clothed in filthy garments, while he stands before the
Angel of Judgment. The Angel orders his servants,
those <i>that stand before him</i>,<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> to give him clean festal
robes. And the prophet, breaking out in sympathy
with what he sees, for the first time takes part in the
Visions. <i>Then I said, Let them also put a clean turban
on his head</i>—the turban being the headdress, in Ezekiel
of the Prince of Israel, and in the Priestly Code of the
High Priest.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> This is done, and the national effect
of his cleansing is explained to the High Priest.
If he remains loyal to the law of Jehovah, he, the
representative of Israel, shall have right of entry to
Jehovah’s presence among the angels who stand there.
But more, he and his colleagues the priests are a
portent of the coming of the Messiah—<i>the Servant of
Jehovah, the Branch</i>, as he has been called by many
prophets.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> A stone has already been set before Joshua,
with seven eyes upon it. God will engrave it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
inscriptions, and on the same day take away the guilt
of the land. Then shall be the peace upon which
Zechariah loves to dwell.</p>

<p><i>And he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing
before the Angel of Jehovah, and the Satan<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> standing
at his right hand to accuse him.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> And Jehovah<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> said
to the Satan: Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan! Jehovah
who makes choice of Jerusalem rebuke thee! Is not
this a brand saved from the fire? But Joshua was
clothed in foul garments while he stood before the Angel.
And he</i>—the Angel—<i>answered and said to those who
stood in his presence, Take the foul garments from off him
(and he said to him, See, I have made thy guilt to pass
away from thee),<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> and clothe him<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> in fresh clothing.
And I said,<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Let them put a clean turban<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> on his head.
And they put the clean turban upon his head, and clothed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
him with garments, the Angel of Jehovah standing up</i>
the while.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> <i>And the Angel of Jehovah certified unto
Joshua, saying: Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, If in My
ways thou walkest, and if My charges thou keepest in
charge, then thou also shall judge My house, and have
charge of My courts, and I will give thee entry<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> among
these who stand in My presence. Hearken now, O
Joshua, high priest, thou and thy fellows who sit before
thee are men of omen, that, lo! I am about to bring
My servant, Branch. For see the stone which I have
set before Joshua, one stone with seven eyes.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Lo, I will
etch the engraving upon it (oracle of Jehovah), and I
will wash away the guilt of that land in one day. In
that day (oracle of Jehovah of Hosts) ye will invite one
another in under vine and under fig-tree.</i></p>

<p>The theological significance of the Vision is as clear
as its consequences in the subsequent theology and
symbolism of Judaism. The uncleanness of Israel
which infests their representative before God is not
defined. Some<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> hold that it includes the guilt of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Israel’s idolatry. But they have to go back to Ezekiel
for this, and we have seen that Zechariah nowhere
mentions or feels the presence of idols among his
people. The Vision itself supplies a better explanation.
Joshua’s filthy garments are replaced by festal and
official robes. He is warned to walk in the whole law
of the Lord, ruling the Temple and guarding Jehovah’s
court. The uncleanness was the opposite of all this.
It was not ethical failure: covetousness, greed, immorality.
It was, as Haggai protested, the neglect of the
Temple, and of the whole worship of Jehovah. If this
be now removed, in all fidelity to the law, the High
Priest shall have access to God, and the Messiah will
come. The High Priest himself shall not be the Messiah—this
dogma is left to a later age to frame. But
before God he will be as one of the angels, and himself
and his faithful priesthood omens of the Messiah. We
need not linger on the significance of this for the
place of the priesthood in later Judaism. Note how
the High Priest is already the religious representative
of his people: their uncleanness is his; when he is
pardoned and cleansed, <i>the uncleanness of the land</i>
is purged away. In such a High Priest Christian
theology has seen the prototype of Christ.</p>

<p>The stone is very difficult to explain. Some have
thought of it as the foundation-stone of the Temple,
which had already been employed as a symbol of the
Messiah and which played so important a part in later
Jewish symbolism.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Others prefer the top-stone of
the Temple, mentioned in chap. iv. 7,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> and others an
altar or substitute for the ark.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Again, some take it
to be a jewel, either on the breastplate of the High
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Priest,<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> or upon the crown afterwards prepared for
Zerubbabel.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> To all of these there are objections.
It is difficult to connect with the foundation-stone
an engraving still to be made; neither the top-stone
of the Temple, nor a jewel on the breastplate of the
priest, nor a jewel on the king’s crown, could properly
be said to be set <i>before</i> the High Priest. We must
rather suppose that the stone is symbolic of the finished
Temple.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> The Temple is the full expression of God’s
providence and care—His <i>seven eyes</i>. Upon it shall
His will be engraved, and by its sacrifices the uncleanness
of the land shall be taken away.</p>

<p>As the Fourth Vision unfolded the dignity and
significance of the High Priest, so in the Fifth we find
discovered the joint glory of himself and Zerubbabel, the
civil head of Israel. And to this is appended a Word
for Zerubbabel himself. In our present text this Word
has become inserted in the middle of the Vision,
vv. 6<i>b</i>-10<i>a</i>; in the translation which follows it has
been removed to the end of the Vision, and the reasons
for this will be found in the notes.</p>

<p>The Vision is of the great golden lamp which stood
in the Temple. In the former Temple, light was
supplied by ten several candlesticks.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> But the Levitical
Code ordained one seven-branched lamp, and such
appears to have stood in the Temple built while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Zechariah was prophesying.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> The lamp Zechariah
sees has also seven branches, but differs in other
respects, and especially in some curious fantastic details
only possible in dream and symbol. Its seven lights
were fed by seven pipes from a bowl or reservoir of
oil which stood higher than themselves, and this was
fed, either directly from two olive-trees which stood to
the right and left of it, or, if ver.&nbsp;12 be genuine,
by two tubes which brought the oil from the trees.
The seven lights are the seven eyes of Jehovah—if,
as we ought, we run the second half of ver.&nbsp;10 on to
the first half of ver.&nbsp;6. The pipes and reservoir are
given no symbolic force; but the olive-trees which
feed them are called <i>the two sons of oil which stand
before the Lord of all the earth</i>. These can only be the
two anointed heads of the community—Zerubbabel,
the civil head, and Joshua, the religious head. Theirs
was the equal and co-ordinate duty of sustaining the
Temple, figured by the whole candelabrum, and ensuring
the brightness of the sevenfold revelation. The Temple,
that is to say, is nothing without the monarchy and
the priesthood behind it; and these stand in the immediate
presence of God. Therefore this Vision, which to
the superficial eye might seem to be a glorification of
the mere machinery of the Temple and its ritual, is
rather to prove that the latter derive all their power from
the national institutions which are behind them, from the
two representatives of the people who in their turn stand
before God Himself. The Temple so near completion
will not of itself reveal God: let not the Jews put their
trust in it, but in the life behind it. And for ourselves
the lesson of the Vision is that which Christian theology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
has been so slow to learn, that God’s revelation under
the old covenant shone not directly through the
material framework, but was mediated by the national
life, whose chief men stood and grew fruitful in His
presence.</p>

<p>One thing is very remarkable. The two sources of
revelation are the King and the Priest. The Prophet
is not mentioned beside them. Nothing could prove
more emphatically the sense in Israel that prophecy
was exhausted.</p>

<p>The appointment of so responsible a position for
Zerubbabel demanded for him a special promise of
grace. And therefore, as Joshua had his promise in
the Fourth Vision, we find Zerubbabel’s appended to
the Fifth. It is one of the great sayings of the Old
Testament: there is none more spiritual and more
comforting. Zerubbabel shall complete the Temple,
and those who scoffed at its small beginnings in the
day of small things shall frankly rejoice when they
see him set the top-stone by plummet in its place.
As the moral obstacles to the future were removed
in the Fourth Vision by the vindication of Joshua
and by his cleansing, so the political obstacles, all the
hindrances described by the Book of Ezra in the
building of the Temple, shall disappear. <i>Before Zerubbabel
the great mountain shall become a plain.</i> And
this, because he shall not work by his own strength,
but the Spirit of Jehovah of Hosts shall do everything.
Again we find that absence of expectation in human
means, and that full trust in God’s own direct action,
which characterise all the prophesying of Zechariah.</p>

<p><i>Then the angel who talked with me returned and roused
me like a man roused out of his sleep. And he said to
me, What seest thou? And I said, I see, and lo! a

candlestick all of gold, and its bowl upon the top of it,
and its seven lamps on it, and seven<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> pipes to the lamps

it, one on the right of the bowl,<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> and one on the left.

said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right

are beside the two golden tubes that pour forth the oil<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>

<p>The religious and political obstacles being now
removed from the future of Israel, Zechariah in the
next two Visions beholds the land purged of its crime
and wickedness. These Visions are very simple, if
somewhat after the ponderous fashion of Ezekiel.</p>

<p>The first of them is the Vision of the removal of the
curse brought upon the land by its civic criminals,
especially thieves and perjurers—the two forms which
crime takes in a poor and rude community like the
colony of the returned exiles. The prophet tells us
he beheld a roll flying. He uses the ordinary Hebrew
name for the rolls of skin or parchment upon which
writing was set down. But the proportions of its
colossal size—twenty cubits by ten—prove that it was
not a cylindrical but an oblong shape which he saw.
It consisted, therefore, of sheets laid on each other like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
our books, and as our word “volume,” which originally
meant, like his own term, a roll, means now an oblong
article, we may use this in our translation. The volume
is the record of the crime of the land, and Zechariah
sees it flying from the land. But it is also the curse
upon this crime, and so again he beholds it entering
every thief’s and perjurer’s house and destroying it.
Smend gives a possible explanation of this: “It
appears that in ancient times curses were written on
pieces of paper and sent down the wind into the
houses”<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> of those against whom they were directed.
But the figure seems rather to be of birds of prey.</p>

<p><i>And I turned and lifted my eyes and looked, and lo!
a volume<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> flying. And he said unto me, What dost thou
see? And I said, I see a volume flying, its length
twenty cubits and its breadth ten. And he said unto
me, This is the curse that is going out upon the face
of all the land. For every thief is hereby purged away
from hence,<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> and every perjurer is hereby purged away
from hence. I have sent it forth—oracle of Jehovah of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Hosts—and it shall enter the thief’s house, and the
house of him that hath sworn falsely by My name, and
it shall roost<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> in the midst of his house and consume it,
with its beams and its stones.</i><a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<p>It is not enough that the curse fly from the land
after destroying every criminal. The living principle
of sin, the power of temptation, must be covered up
and removed. This is the subject of the Seventh
Vision.</p>

<p>The prophet sees an ephah, the largest vessel in use
among the Jews, of more than seven gallons capacity,
and round<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> like a barrel. Presently the leaden top is
lifted, and the prophet sees a woman inside. This is
Wickedness, feminine because she figures the power
of temptation. She is thrust back into the barrel,
the leaden lid is pushed down, and the whole carried
off by two other female figures, winged like the strong,
far-flying stork, into the land of Shin‛ar, “which at
that time had the general significance of the counterpart
of the Holy Land,”<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> and was the proper home
of all that was evil.</p>

<p><i>And the angel of Jehovah who spake with me came
forward<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and said to me, Lift now thine eyes and see
what this is that comes forth. And I said, What is it?
And he said, This is a bushel coming forth. And he said,
This is their transgression<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> in all the land.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> And behold!
the round leaden </i>top<i> was lifted up, and lo!<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> a woman
sitting inside the bushel. And he said, This is the
Wickedness, and he thrust her back into the bushel, and
thrust the leaden disc upon the mouth of it. And I lifted
mine eyes and looked, and lo! two women came forth with
the wind in their wings, for they had wings like storks’
wings, and they bore the bushel betwixt earth and heaven.
And I said to the angel that talked with me, Whither do
they carry the bushel? And he said to me, To build it
a house in the land of Shin‛ar, that it may be fixed and
brought to rest there on a place of its own.</i><a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>We must not allow this curious imagery to hide
from us its very spiritual teaching. If Zechariah is
weighted in these Visions by the ponderous fashion
of Ezekiel, he has also that prophet’s truly moral spirit.
He is not contented with the ritual atonement for sin,
nor with the legal punishment of crime. The living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
power of sin must be banished from Israel; and this
cannot be done by any efforts of men themselves, but
by God’s action only, which is thorough and effectual.
If the figures by which this is illustrated appear to us
grotesque and heavy, let us remember how they would
suit the imagination of the prophet’s own day. Let us
lay to heart their eternally valid doctrine, that sin is
not a formal curse, nor only expressed in certain social
crimes, nor exhausted by the punishment of these, but,
as a power of attraction and temptation to all men, it
must be banished from the heart, and can be banished
only by God.</p>

<p>As the series of Visions opened with one of the universal
providence of God, so they close with another of
the same. The First Vision had postponed God’s overthrow
of the nations till His own time, and this the
Last Vision now describes as begun, the religious and
moral needs of Israel having meanwhile been met by
the Visions which come between, and every obstacle to
God’s action for the deliverance of His people being
removed.</p>

<p>The prophet sees four chariots, with horses of different
colour in each, coming out from between two
mountains of brass. The horsemen of the First
Vision were bringing in reports: these chariots are
coming forth with their commissions from the presence
of the Lord of all the earth. They are the four winds
of heaven, servants of Him who maketh the winds His
angels. They are destined for different quarters of
the world. The prophet has not been admitted to
the Presence, and does not know what exactly they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
have been commissioned to do; that is to say,
Zechariah is ignorant of the actual political processes
by which the nations are to be overthrown and Israel
glorified before them. But his Angel-interpreter tells
him that the black horses go north, the white west,
and the dappled south, while the horses of the fourth
chariot, impatient because no direction is assigned to
them, are ordered to roam up and down through the
earth. It is striking that none are sent eastward.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
This appears to mean that, in Zechariah’s day, no
power oppressed or threatened Israel from that direction;
but in the north there was the centre of the
Persian Empire, to the south Egypt, still a possible
master of the world, and to the west the new forces
of Europe that in less than a generation were to prove
themselves a match for Persia. The horses of the
fourth chariot are therefore given the charge to exercise
supervision upon the whole earth—unless in ver.&nbsp;7 we
should translate, not <i>earth</i>, but <i>land</i>, and understand
a commission to patrol the land of Israel. The centre
of the world’s power is in the north, and therefore the
black horses, which are dispatched in that direction,
are explicitly described as charged to bring God’s
spirit, that is His anger or His power, to bear on that
quarter of the world.</p>

<p><i>And once more<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> I lifted mine eyes and looked, and lo!
four chariots coming forward from between two mountains,
and the mountains were mountains of brass. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>

chariot black horses, and in the third chariot white

me, What are these, my lord? And the angel answered
and said to me, These be the four winds of heaven that
come forth from presenting themselves before the Lord of
all the earth.</i><a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> That <i>with the black horses goes forth to

go forth and seek to go, to march up and down on the
earth. And he said, Go, march up and down on the
earth; and they marched up and down on the earth.

go forth to the land of the north have brought my spirit

<p>The heathen being overthrown, Israel is free, and
may have her king again. Therefore Zechariah is
ordered—it would appear on the same day as that on
which he received the Visions—to visit a certain
deputation from the captivity in Babylon, Heldai,
Tobiyah and Yedayah, at the house of Josiah the son
of Zephaniah, where they have just arrived; and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
select from the gifts they have brought enough silver
and gold to make circlets for a crown. The present
text assigns this crown to Joshua, the high priest, but
as we have already remarked, and will presently prove
in the notes to the translation, the original text assigned
it to Zerubbabel, the civil head of the community, and
gave Joshua, the priest, a place at his right hand—the
two to act in perfect concord with each other. The
text has suffered some other injuries, which it is easy
to amend; and the end of it has been broken off in
the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE ANGELS OF THE VISIONS</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">ECHARIAH</span> i. 7—vi. 8</p>

<p class="noindent">
Among the influences of the Exile which contributed
the material of Zechariah’s Visions we included
a considerable development of Israel’s belief in Angels.
The general subject is in itself so large, and the Angels
play so many parts in the Visions, that it is necessary
to devote to them a separate chapter.</p>

<p>From the earliest times the Hebrews had conceived
their Divine King to be surrounded by a court of
ministers, who besides celebrating His glory went forth
from His presence to execute His will upon earth. In
this latter capacity they were called Messengers,
Male’akim, which the Greeks translated Angeloi, and
so gave us our Angels. The origin of this conception is
wrapt in obscurity. It may have been partly due to
a belief, shared by all early peoples, in the existence
of superhuman beings inferior to the gods,<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> but even
without this it must have sprung up in the natural
tendency to provide the royal deity of a people with a
court, an army and servants. In the pious minds of
early Israel there must have been a kind of necessity
to believe and develop this—a necessity imposed <i>firstly</i>
by the belief in Jehovah’s residence as confined to one
spot, Sinai or Jerusalem, from which He Himself went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
forth only upon great occasions to the deliverance of
His people as a whole; and <i>secondly</i> by the unwillingness
to conceive of His personal appearance in missions
of a menial nature, or to represent Him in the human
form in which, according to primitive ideas, He could
alone hold converse with men.</p>

<p>It can easily be understood how a religion, which was
above all a religion of revelation, should accept such
popular conceptions in its constant record of the appearance
of God and His Word in human life. Accordingly,
in the earliest documents of the Hebrews, we find angels
who bring to Israel the blessings, curses and commands of
Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> Apart from this duty and their human appearance,
these beings are not conceived to be endowed
either with character or, if we may judge by their namelessness,<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
with individuality. They are the Word of
God personified. Acting as God’s mouthpiece, they are
merged in Him, and so completely that they often speak
of themselves by the Divine <i>I</i>.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> “The <i>function</i> of an
Angel so overshadows his <i>personality</i> that the Old Testament
does not ask who or what this Angel is, but what he
does. And the answer to the last question is, that he
represents God to man so directly and fully that when
he speaks or acts God Himself is felt to speak or act.”<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>
Besides the carriage of the Divine Word, angels bring
back to their Lord report of all that happens: kings are
said, in popular language, to be <i>as wise as the wisdom of
an angel of God, to know all the things that are in the earth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
They are also employed in the deliverance and discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
of His people.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> By them come the pestilence,<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> and the
restraint of those who set themselves against God’s
will.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p>Now the prophets before the Exile had so spiritual
a conception of God, worked so immediately from His
presence, and above all were so convinced of His
personal and practical interest in the affairs of His
people, that they felt no room for Angels between Him
and their hearts, and they do not employ Angels, except
when Isaiah in his inaugural vision penetrates to the
heavenly palace and court of the Most High.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Even
when Amos sees a plummet laid to the walls of Jerusalem,
it is by the hands of Jehovah Himself,<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> and we have
not encountered an Angel in the mediation of the Word
to any of the prophets whom we have already studied.
But Angels reappear, though not under the name, in the
visions of Ezekiel, the first prophet of the Exile. They
are in human form, and he calls them <i>Men</i>. Some execute
God’s wrath upon Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> and one, whose appearance
is as the appearance of brass, acts as the interpreter
of God’s will to the prophet, and instructs him in the
details of the building of City and Temple.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> When the
glory of Jehovah appears and Jehovah Himself speaks
to the prophet out of the Temple, this <i>Man</i> stands by
the prophet,<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> distinct from the Deity, and afterwards
continues his work of explanation. “Therefore,” as
Dr. Davidson remarks, “it is not the sense of distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to which God is removed that causes Ezekiel to create
these intermediaries.” The necessity for them rather
arises from the same natural feeling, which we have
suggested as giving rise to the earliest conceptions
of Angels: the unwillingness, namely, to engage the
Person of God Himself in the subordinate task of
explaining the details of the Temple. Note, too, how
the Divine Voice, which speaks to Ezekiel out of the
Temple, blends and becomes one with the <i>Man</i> standing
at his side. Ezekiel’s Angel-interpreter is simply one
function of the Word of God.</p>

<p>Many of the features of Ezekiel’s Angels appear in
those of Zechariah. <i>The four smiths</i> or smiters of the
four horns recall the six executioners of the wicked in
Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> Like Ezekiel’s Interpreter, they are called
<i>Men</i>,<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> and like him one appears as Zechariah’s instructor
and guide: <i>he who talked with me</i>.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> But while Zechariah
calls these beings Men, he also gives them the ancient
name, which Ezekiel had not used, of Male’akim, <i>messengers</i>,
<i>angels</i>. The Instructor is <i>the Angel who talked
with me</i>. In the First Vision, <i>the Man riding the brown
horse, the Man that stood among the myrtles</i>, is <i>the Angel
of Jehovah that stood among the myrtles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> The Interpreter
is also called <i>the Angel of Jehovah</i>, and if our text
of the First Vision be correct, the two of them are
curiously mingled, as if both were functions of the same
Word of God, and in personality not to be distinguished
from each other. The Reporting Angel among
the myrtles takes up the duty of the Interpreting
Angel and explains the Vision to the prophet. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Fourth Vision this dissolving view is carried further,
and the Angel of Jehovah is interchangeable with
Jehovah Himself;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> just as in the Vision of Ezekiel the
Divine Voice from the Glory and the Man standing
beside the prophet are curiously mingled. Again in
the Fourth Vision we hear of those <i>who stand in the
presence of Jehovah</i>,<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> and in the Eighth of executant
angels coming out from His presence with commissions
upon the whole earth.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>In the Visions of Zechariah, then, as in the earlier
books, we see the Lord of all the earth, surrounded by
a court of angels, whom He sends forth in human form
to interpret His Word and execute His will, and in
their doing of this there is the same indistinctness of
individuality, the same predominance of function over
personality. As with Ezekiel, one stands out more
clearly than the rest, to be the prophet’s interpreter,
whom, as in the earlier visions of angels, Zechariah
calls <i>my lord</i>,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> but even he melts into the figures of
the rest. These are the old and borrowed elements in
Zechariah’s doctrine of Angels. But he has added to
them in several important particulars, which make his
Visions an intermediate stage between the Book of
Ezekiel and the very intricate angelology of later
Judaism.</p>

<p>In the first place, Zechariah is the earliest prophet
who introduces orders and ranks among the angels.
In his Fourth Vision the Angel of Jehovah is the Divine
Judge <i>before whom</i><a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> Joshua appears with the Adversary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
He also has others standing <i>before him</i><a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> to execute his
sentences. In the Third Vision, again, the Interpreting
Angel does not communicate directly with Jehovah, but
receives his words from another Angel who has come
forth.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> All these are symptoms, that even with a
prophet, who so keenly felt as Zechariah did the ethical
directness of God’s word and its pervasiveness through
public life, there had yet begun to increase those
feelings of God’s sublimity and awfulness, which in
the later thought of Israel lifted Him to so far a
distance from men, and created so complex a host of
intermediaries, human and superhuman, between the
worshipping heart and the Throne of Grace. We can
best estimate the difference in this respect between
Zechariah and the earlier prophets whom we have
studied by remarking that his characteristic phrase
<i>talked with me</i>, literally <i>spake in</i> or <i>by me</i>, which he uses
of the Interpreting Angel, is used by Habakkuk of God
Himself.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> To the same awful impressions of the Godhead
is perhaps due the first appearance of the Angel
as intercessor. Amos, Isaiah and Jeremiah themselves
directly interceded with God for the people; but with
Zechariah it is the Interpreting Angel who intercedes,
and who in return receives the Divine comfort.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> In this
angelic function, the first of its kind in Scripture, we
see the small and explicable beginnings of a belief
destined to assume enormous dimensions in the
development of the Church’s worship. The supplication
of Angels, the faith in their intercession and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the prevailing prayers of the righteous dead, which
has been so egregiously multiplied in certain sections
of Christendom, may be traced to the same increasing
sense of the distance and awfulness of God, but is
to be corrected by the faith Christ has taught us of
the nearness of our Father in Heaven, and of His
immediate care of His every human child.</p>

<p>The intercession of the Angel in the First Vision is
also a step towards that identification of special Angels
with different peoples which we find in the Book of
Daniel. This tells us of heavenly princes not only
for Israel—<i>Michael, your prince, the great prince which
standeth up for the children of thy people</i><a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>—but for the
heathen nations, a conception the first beginnings
of which we see in a prophecy that was perhaps
not far from being contemporaneous with Zechariah.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>
Zechariah’s Vision of a hierarchy among the angels was
also destined to further development. The head of the
patrol among the myrtles, and the Judge-Angel before
whom Joshua appears, are the first Archangels. We
know how these were further specialised, and had even
personalities and names given them by both Jewish and
Christian writers.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p>Among the Angels described in the Old Testament,
we have seen some charged with powers of hindrance
and destruction—<i>a troop of angels of evil</i>.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> They too
are the servants of God, who is the author of all evil
as well as good,<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> and the instruments of His wrath.
Providence. Where wilful souls have to be misled,
But the temptation of men is also part of His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the <i>spirit</i> who does so, as in Ahab’s case, comes from
Jehovah’s presence.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> All these spirits are just as
devoid of character and personality as the rest of the
angelic host. They work evil as mere instruments:
neither malice nor falseness is attributed to themselves.
They are not rebel nor fallen angels, but obedient to
Jehovah. Nay, like Ezekiel’s and Zechariah’s Angels
of the Word, the Angel who tempts David to number
the people is interchangeable with God Himself.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
Kindred to the duty of tempting men is that of discipline,
in its forms both of restraining or accusing
the guilty, and of vexing the righteous in order to test
them. For both of these the same verb is used, “to
satan,”<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> in the general sense of <i>withstanding</i>, or antagonising.
The Angel of Jehovah stood in Balaam’s
way <i>to satan him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> The noun, <i>the Satan</i>, is used
repeatedly of a human foe.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> But in two passages,
of which Zechariah’s Fourth Vision is one, and the
other the Prologue to Job,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> the name is given to an
Angel, one of <i>the sons of Elohim</i>, or Divine powers
who receive their commission from Jehovah. The
noun is not yet, what it afterwards became,<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> a proper
name; but has the definite article, <i>the Adversary</i> or
<i>Accuser</i>—that is, the Angel to whom that function
was assigned. With Zechariah his business is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
official one of prosecutor in the supreme court of
Jehovah, and when his work is done he disappears.
Yet, before he does so, we see for the first time in
connection with any angel a gleam of character. This
is revealed by the Lord’s rebuke of him. There
is something blameworthy in the accusation of
Joshua: not indeed false witness, for Israel’s guilt
is patent in the foul garments of their High Priest,
but hardness or malice, that would seek to prevent
the Divine grace. In the Book of Job <i>the Satan</i> is
also a function, even here not a fallen or rebel
angel, but one of God’s court,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> the instrument of
discipline or chastisement. Yet, in that he himself
suggests his cruelties and is represented as forward
and officious in their infliction, a character is imputed
to him even more clearly than in Zechariah’s Vision.
But the Satan still shares that identification with his
function which we have seen to characterise all the
angels of the Old Testament, and therefore he disappears
from the drama so soon as his place in its
high argument is over.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>In this description of the development of Israel’s
doctrine of Angels, and of Zechariah’s contributions
to it, we have not touched upon the question whether
the development was assisted by Israel’s contact with
the Persian religion and with the system of Angels which
the latter contains. For several reasons the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
is a difficult one. But so far as present evidence goes,
it makes for a negative answer. Scholars, who are in
no way prejudiced against the theory of a large Persian
influence upon Israel, declare that the religion of
Persia affected the Jewish doctrine of Angels “only in
secondary points,” such as their “number and personality,
and the existence of demons and evil spirits.”<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>
Our own discussion has shown us that Zechariah’s
Angels, in spite of the new features they introduce,
are in substance one with the Angels of pre-exilic
Israel. Even the Satan is primarily a function, and
one of the servants of God. If he has developed an
immoral character, this cannot be attributed to the
influence of Persian belief in a Spirit of evil opposed
to the Spirit of good in the universe, but may be
explained by the native, or selfish, resentment of Israel
against their prosecutor before the bar of Jehovah.
Nor can we fail to remark that this character of evil
appears in the Satan, not, as in the Persian religion, in
general opposition to goodness, but as thwarting that
saving grace which was so peculiarly Jehovah’s own.
And Jehovah said to the Satan, <i>Jehovah rebuke thee,
O Satan, yea, Jehovah who hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke
thee! Is not this a brand plucked from the burning?</i></p>

<p class="captitle">“&thinsp;THE SEED OF PEACE”</p>

<p class="csubtitle">Z<span class="small">ECHARIAH</span> vii., viii.</p>

<p class="noindent">
The Visions have revealed the removal of the guilt
of the land, the restoration of Israel to their
standing before God, the revival of the great national
institutions, and God’s will to destroy the heathen forces
of the world. With the Temple built, Israel should
be again in the position which she enjoyed before the
Exile. Zechariah, therefore, proceeds to exhort his
people to put away the fasts which the Exile had
made necessary, and address themselves, as of old, to
the virtues and duties of the civic life. And he introduces
his orations to this end by a natural appeal to
the experience of the former days.</p>

<p>The occasion came to him when the Temple had
been building for two years, and when some of its
services were probably resumed.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> A deputation of Jews
appeared in Jerusalem and raised the question of the
continuance of the great Fasts of the Exile. Who the
deputation were is not certain: probably we ought to
delete <i>Bethel</i> from the second verse, and read either
<i>El-sar’eser sent Regem-Melekh and his men to the house
of Jehovah to propitiate Jehovah</i>, or else <i>the house of
El-sar’eser sent Regem-Melekh and his men to propitiate
Jehovah</i>. It has been thought that they came from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the Jews in Babylon: this would agree with their arrival
in the ninth month to inquire about a fast in the fifth
month. But Zechariah’s answer is addressed to Jews
in Judæa. The deputation limited their inquiry to
the fast of the fifth month, which commemorated the
burning of the Temple and the City, now practically
restored. But with a breadth of view which reveals
the prophet rather than the priest, Zechariah replies,
in the following chapter, upon all the fasts by which
Israel for seventy years had bewailed her ruin and
exile. He instances two, that of the fifth month,
and that of the seventh month, the date of the murder
of Gedaliah, when the last poor remnant of a Jewish
state was swept away.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> With a boldness which
recalls Amos to the very letter, Zechariah asks his
people whether in those fasts they fasted at all to
their God. Jehovah had not charged them, and in
fasting they had fasted for themselves, just as in
eating and drinking they had eaten and drunken to
themselves. They should rather hearken to the words
He really sent them. In a passage, the meaning of
which has been perverted by the intrusion of the eighth
verse, that therefore ought to be deleted, Zechariah
recalls what those words of Jehovah had been in the
former times when the land was inhabited and the
national life in full course. They were not ceremonial;
they were ethical: they commanded justice, kindness,
and the care of the helpless and the poor. And it
was in consequence of the people’s disobedience to
those words that all the ruin came upon them for
which they now annually mourned. The moral is
obvious if unexpressed. Let them drop their fasts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
and practise the virtues the neglect of which had made
their fasts a necessity. It is a sane and practical
word, and makes us feel how much Zechariah has
inherited of the temper of Amos and Isaiah. He rests,
as before, upon the letter of the ancient oracles, but
only so as to bring out their spirit. With such an
example of the use of ancient Scripture, it is deplorable
that so many men, both among the Jews and the
Christians, should have devoted themselves to the
letter at the expense of the spirit.</p>

<p><i>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the
king, that the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah on the
fourth of the ninth month, Kislev. For there sent to
</i>the<i> house </i>of Jehovah,<i> El-sar’eser and Regem-Melekh
and his men,<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> to propitiate<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>
Jehovah, to ask of the priests
which were in the house of Jehovah of Hosts and of the
prophets as follows: Shall I weep in the fifth month
with fasting as I have now done so many years? And
the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came to me: Speak now
to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying:
When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the
seventh month,<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> and this for seventy years, did ye fast at
all to Me? And when ye eat and when ye drink, are not
ye the eaters and ye the drinkers? Are not these<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
words which Jehovah proclaimed by the hand of the former
prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and at peace,
with her cities round about her, and the Negeb and the
Shephelah were inhabited?</i></p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a><i>Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts: Judge true judgment,
and practise towards each other kindness and mercy;
oppress neither widow nor orphan, stranger nor poor, and
think not evil in your hearts towards one another. But
they refused to hearken, and turned a rebellious shoulder,<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>
and their ears they dulled from listening. And their
heart they made adamant, so as not to hear the Torah
and the words which Jehovah of Hosts sent through His
Spirit by the hand of the former prophets; and there
was great wrath from Jehovah of Hosts. And it came
to pass that, as He had called and they heard not, so
they shall call and I will not hear, said Jehovah of
Hosts, but I will whirl<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> them away among nations
whom they know not. And the land was laid waste
behind them, without any to pass to and fro, and they
made the pleasant land desolate.</i></p>

<p>There follow upon this deliverance ten other short
oracles: chap. viii. Whether all of this decalogue are
to be dated from the same time as the answer to the
deputation about the fasts is uncertain. Some of them
appear rather to belong to an earlier date, for they
reflect the situation, and even the words, of Haggai’s
oracles, and represent the advent of Jehovah to
Jerusalem as still future. But they return to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
question of the fasts, treating it still more comprehensively
than before, and they close with a promise,
fitly spoken as the Temple grew to completion, of the
coming of the heathen to worship at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the tender charm and
strong simplicity of these prophecies,<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> and there is little
now to add except the translation of them. As with
the older prophets, and especially the great Evangelist
of the Exile, they start from the glowing love of
Jehovah for His people, to which nothing is impossible;<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>
they promise a complete return of the
scattered Jews to their land, and are not content
except with the assurance of a world converted to
the faith of their God. With Haggai Zechariah
promises the speedy end of the poverty of the little
colony; and he adds his own characteristic notes of
a reign of peace to be used for hearty labour, bringing
forth a great prosperity. Only let men be true
and just and kind, thinking no evil of each other,
as in those hard days when hunger and the fierce
rivalry for sustenance made every one’s neighbour
his enemy, and the petty life, devoid of large interests
for the commonweal, filled their hearts with envy and
malice. For ourselves the chief profit of these beautiful
oracles is their lesson that the remedy for the
sordid tempers and cruel hatreds, engendered by the
fierce struggle for existence, is found in civic and
religious hopes, in a noble ideal for the national
life, and in the assurance that God’s Love is at the
back of all, with nothing impossible to it. Amid
these glories, however, the heart will probably thank
Zechariah most for his immortal picture of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
streets of the new Jerusalem: old men and women
sitting in the sun, boys and girls playing in all the
open places. The motive of it, as we have seen,
was found in the circumstances of his own day.
Like many another emigration, for religion’s sake, from
the heart of civilisation to a barren coast, the poor
colony of Jerusalem consisted chiefly of men, young
and in middle life. The barren years gave no encouragement
to marriage. The constant warfare with
neighbouring tribes allowed few to reach grey hairs.
It was a rough and a hard society, unblessed by the
two great benedictions of life, childhood and old age.
But this should all be changed, and Jerusalem filled
with placid old men and women, and with joyous boys
and girls. The oracle, we say, had its motive in
Zechariah’s day. But what an oracle for these times
of ours! Whether in the large cities of the old world,
where so few of the workers may hope for a quiet old
age, sitting in the sun, and the children’s days of play
are shortened by premature toil and knowledge of evil;
or in the newest fringes of the new world, where men’s
hardness and coarseness are, in the struggle for gold,
unawed by reverence for age and unsoftened by the
fellowship of childhood,—Zechariah’s great promise
is equally needed. Even there shall it be fulfilled
if men will remember his conditions—that the first
regard of a community, however straitened in means,
be the provision of religion, that truth and whole-hearted
justice abound in the gates, with love and
loyalty in every heart towards every other.</p>



<p><i>And the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came, saying:—</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: I am jealous for
Zion with a great jealousy, and with great anger am I
jealous for her.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
2. <i>Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Zion, and
I dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall
be called the City of Troth,<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> and the mountain of Jehovah
of Hosts the Holy Mountain.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Old men and old
women shall yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with
staff in hand, for fulness of days; and the streets of
the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in her
streets.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Because it seems too
wonderful to the remnant of this people in those days,
shall it also seem too wonderful to Me?—oracle of Jehovah
of Hosts.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Lo! I am about to

the land of the setting of the sun; and I will bring them

they shall be to Me for a people,<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> and I will be to them

<p>6. <i>Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Strengthen your

from the mouth of the prophets, since<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> the day when the
House of Jehovah of Hosts was founded: the sanctuary
was to be built! For before those days there was
no gain for man,<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> and none to be made by cattle; and
neither for him that went out nor for him that came in was
there any peace from the adversary, and I set every man’s

things which ye shall do: Speak truth to one another;

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF “&thinsp;MALACHI”</p>

<p class="noindent">
This book, the last in the arrangement of the
prophetic canon, bears the title: <i>Burden</i> or
<i>Oracle of the Word of Jehovah to Israel by the hand of
malĕ’akhi</i>. Since at least the second century of our
era the word has been understood as a proper name,
Malachi or Malachias. But there are strong objections
to this, as well as to the genuineness of the whole title,
and critics now almost universally agree that the book
was originally anonymous.</p>

<p>It is true that neither in form nor in meaning is
there any insuperable obstacle to our understanding
“malĕ’akhi” as the name of a person. If so, however,
it cannot have been, as some have suggested, an abbreviation
of Malĕ’akhiyah, for, according to the analogy
of other names of such formation, this could only
express the impossible meaning <i>Jehovah is Angel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>
But, as it stands, it might have meant <i>My Angel</i>
or <i>Messenger</i>, or it may be taken as an adjective,
<i>Angelicus</i><a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Either of these meanings would form a
natural name for a Jewish child, and a very suitable
one for a prophet. There is evidence, however, that
some of the earliest Jewish interpreters did not think
of the title as containing the name of a person.
The Septuagint read <i>by the hand of His messenger</i>,<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>
“malĕ’akho”; and the Targum of Jonathan, while retaining
“malĕ’akhi,” rendered it <i>My messenger</i>, adding
that it was Ezra the Scribe who was thus designated.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>
This opinion was adopted by Calvin.</p>

<p>Recent criticism has shown that, whether the word
was originally intended as a personal name or not, it
was a purely artificial one borrowed from chap. iii. 1,
<i>Behold, I send My messenger</i>, “malĕ’akhi,” for the title,
which itself has been added by the editor of the Twelve
Prophets in the form in which we now have them.
The peculiar words of the title, <i>Burden</i> or <i>Oracle of the
Word of Jehovah</i>, occur nowhere else than in the titles
of the two prophecies which have been appended to
the Book of Zechariah, chap. ix. 1 and chap. xii. 1, and
immediately precede this Book of “Malachi.” In chap.
ix. 1 <i>the Word of Jehovah</i> belongs to the text; <i>Burden</i>
or <i>Oracle</i> has been inserted before it as a title; then the
whole phrase has been inserted as a title in chap. xii. 1.
These two pieces are anonymous, and nothing is more
likely than that another anonymous prophecy should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
have received, when attached to them, the same heading.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>
The argument is not final, but it is the most probable
explanation of the data, and agrees with the other facts.
The cumulative force of all that we have stated—the
improbability of malĕ’akhi being a personal name, the
fact that the earliest versions do not treat it as such,
the obvious suggestion for its invention in the malĕ’akhi
of chap. iii. 1, the absence of a father’s name and place
of residence, and the character of the whole title—is
enough for the opinion rapidly spreading among critics
that our book was, like so much more in the Old
Testament, originally anonymous.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> The author attacks
the religious authorities of his day; he belongs to a
pious remnant of his people, who are overborne and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
perhaps oppressed by the majority.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> In these facts,
which are all we know of his personality, he found
sufficient reason for not attaching his name to his
prophecy.</p>

<p>The book is also undated, but it reflects its period
almost as clearly as do the dated Books of Haggai and
Zechariah. The conquest of Edom by the Nabateans,
which took place during the Exile,<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> is already past.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>
The Jews are under a Persian viceroy.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> They are in
touch with a heathen power, which does not tyrannise
over them, for this book is the first to predict no
judgment upon the heathen, and the first, moreover, to
acknowledge that among the heathen the true God is
worshipped <i>from the rising to the setting of the sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>
The only judgment predicted is one upon the false
and disobedient portion of Israel, whose arrogance and
success have cast true Israelites into despair.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> All
this reveals a time when the Jews were favourably
treated by their Persian lords. The reign must be
that of Artaxerxes Longhand, 464—424.</p>

<p>The Temple has been finished,<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> and years enough
have elapsed to disappoint those fervid hopes with
which about 518 Zechariah expected its completion.
The congregation has grown worldly and careless. In
particular the priests are corrupt and partial in the
administration of the Law.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> There have been many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
marriages with the heathen women of the land;<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> and
the laity have failed to pay the tithes and other dues
to the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> These are the evils against which we
find strenuous measures directed by Ezra, who returned
from Babylon in 458,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> and by Nehemiah, who visited
Jerusalem as its governor for the first time in 445 and
for the second time in 433. Besides, “the religious
spirit of the book is that of the prayers of Ezra and
Nehemiah. A strong sense of the unique privileges of
the children of Jacob, the objects of electing love,<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> the
children of the Divine Father,<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> is combined with an
equally strong assurance of Jehovah’s righteousness
amidst the many miseries that pressed on the unhappy
inhabitants of Judæa.... Obedience to the Law is
the sure path to blessedness.”<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> But the question still
remains whether the Book of “Malachi” prepared
for, assisted or followed up the reforms of Ezra and
Nehemiah. An ancient tradition already alluded to<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
assigned the authorship to Ezra himself.</p>

<p>Recent criticism has been divided among the years
immediately before Ezra’s arrival in 458, those immediately
before Nehemiah’s first visit in 445, those
between his first government and his second, and
those after Nehemiah’s disappearance from Jerusalem.
But the years in which Nehemiah held office may be
excluded, because the Jews are represented as bringing
gifts to the governor, which Nehemiah tells us he did
not allow to be brought to him.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> The whole question
depends upon what Law was in practice in Israel when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the book was written. In 445 Ezra and Nehemiah, by
solemn covenant between the people and Jehovah, instituted
the code which we now know as the Priestly Code
of the Pentateuch. Before that year the ritual and
social life of the Jews appear to have been directed by
the Deuteronomic Code. Now the Book of “Malachi”
enforces a practice with regard to the tithes, which
agrees more closely with the Priestly Code than it
does with Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy commands
that every third year the whole tithe is to be given to
the Levites and the poor who reside <i>within the gates</i> of
the giver, and is there to be eaten by them. “Malachi”
commands that the whole tithe be brought into the
storehouse of the Temple for the Levites in service
there; and so does the Priestly Code.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> On this
ground many date the Book of “Malachi” after 445.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>
But “Malachi’s” divergence from Deuteronomy on this
point may be explained by the fact that in his time
there were practically no Levites outside Jerusalem;
and it is to be noticed that he joins the tithe with the
tĕrûmah or heave-offering exactly as Deuteronomy
does.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> On other points of the Law he agrees rather
with Deuteronomy than with the Priestly Code. He
follows Deuteronomy in calling the priests <i>sons of
Levi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> while the Priestly Code limits the priesthood to
the sons of Aaron. He seems to quote Deuteronomy
when forbidding the oblation of blind, lame and sick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
beasts;<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> appears to differ from the Priestly Code
which allows the sacrificial beast to be male or female,
when he assumes that it is a male;<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> follows the expressions
of Deuteronomy and not those of the Priestly
Code in detailing the sins of the people;<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> and uses the
Deuteronomic phrases <i>the Law of Moses</i>, <i>My servant
Moses</i>, <i>statutes and judgments</i>, and <i>Horeb</i> for the Mount of
the Law.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> For the rest, he echoes or implies only Ezekiel
and that part of the Priestly Code<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> which is regarded
as earlier than the rest, and probably from the first
years of exile. Moreover he describes the Torah as
not yet fully codified.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> The priests still deliver it in a
way improbable after 445. The trouble of the heathen
marriages with which he deals (if indeed the verses on
this subject be authentic and not a later intrusion<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>)
was that which engaged Ezra’s attention on his arrival
in 458, but Ezra found that it had already for some
time been vexing the heads of the community. While,
therefore, we are obliged to date the Book of “Malachi”
before 445 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, it is uncertain whether it preceded or
followed Ezra’s attempts at reform in 458. Most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
critics now think that it preceded them.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>The Book of “Malachi” is an argument with the
prophet’s contemporaries, not only with the wicked
among them, who in forgetfulness of what Jehovah is
corrupt the ritual, fail to give the Temple its dues,
abuse justice, marry foreign wives,<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> divorce their own,
and commit various other sins; but also with the
pious, who, equally forgetful of God’s character, are
driven by the arrogance of the wicked to ask, whether
He loves Israel, whether He is a God of justice, and
to murmur that it is vain to serve Him. To these two
classes of his contemporaries the prophet has the
following answers. God does love Israel. He is worshipped
everywhere among the heathen. He is the
Father of all Israel. He will bless His people when
they put away all abuses from their midst and pay
their religious dues; and His Day of Judgment is
coming, when the good shall be separated from the
wicked. But before it come, Elijah the prophet will
be sent to attempt the conversion of the wicked, or at
least to call the nation to decide for Jehovah. This
argument is pursued in seven or perhaps eight paragraphs,
which do not show much consecutiveness, but
are addressed, some to the wicked, and some to the
despairing adherents of Jehovah.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Chap. i. 2–5.—To those who ask how God loves Israel, the proof
of Jehovah’s election of Israel is shown in the fall of the Edomites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
2. Chap. i. 6–14.—Charge against the people of dishonouring their
God, whom even the heathen reverence.</p>

<p>3. Chap. ii. 1–9.—Charge against the priests, who have broken the
covenant God made of old with Levi, and debased their high office by
not reverencing Jehovah, by misleading the people and by perverting
justice. A curse is therefore fallen on them—they are contemptible
in the people’s eyes.</p>

<p>4. Chap. ii. 10–16.—A charge against the people for their treachery
to each other; instanced in the heathen marriages, if the two verses,
11 and 12, upon this be authentic, and in their divorce of their wives.</p>

<p>5. Chap. ii. 17—iii. 5 or 6.—Against those who in the midst of such
evils grow sceptical about Jehovah. His Angel, or Himself, will
come <i>first</i> to purge the priesthood and ritual that there may be pure
sacrifices, and <i>second</i> to rid the land of its criminals and sinners.</p>

<p>6. Chap. iii. 6 or 7–12.—A charge against the people of neglecting
tithes. Let these be paid, disasters shall cease and the land be blessed.</p>

<p>7. Chap. iii. 13–21 Heb., Chap. iii. 13—iv. 2 LXX. and Eng.—Another
charge against the pious for saying it is vain to serve God.
God will rise to action and separate between the good and bad in
the terrible Day of His coming.</p>

<p>8. To this, Chap. iii. 22–24 Heb., Chap. iv. 3–5 Eng., adds a call
to keep the Law, and a promise that Elijah will be sent to see whether
he may not convert the people before the Day of the Lord comes
upon them with its curse.</p></div>

<p>The authenticity of no part of the book has been
till now in serious question. Böhme,<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> indeed, took
the last three verses for a later addition, on account
of their Deuteronomic character, but, as Kuenen points
out, this is in agreement with other parts of the book.
Sufficient attention has not yet been paid to the question
of the integrity of the text. The Septuagint offers a
few emendations.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> There are other passages obviously
or probably corrupt.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> The text of the title, as we
have seen, is uncertain, and probably a later addition.
Professor Robertson Smith has called attention to
chap. ii. 16, where the Massoretic punctuation seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
to have been determined with the desire to support
the rendering of the Targum “if thou hatest her put
her away,” and so pervert into a permission to divorce
a passage which forbids divorce almost as clearly as
Christ Himself did. But in truth the whole of this
passage, chap. ii. 10–16, is in such a curious state
that we can hardly believe in its integrity. It opens
with the statement that God is the Father of all us
Israelites, and with the challenge, why then are we
faithless to each other?—ver.&nbsp;10. But vv. 11 and 12 do
not give an instance of this: they describe the marriages
with the heathen women of the land, which is not a
proof of faithlessness between Israelites. Such a proof
is furnished only by vv. 13–16, with their condemnation
of those who divorce the wives of their youth. The
verses, therefore, cannot lie in their proper order, and
vv. 13–16 ought to follow immediately upon ver.&nbsp;10.
This raises the question of the authenticity of vv. 11
and 12, against the heathen marriages. If they bear
such plain marks of having been intruded into their
position, we can understand the possibility of such an
intrusion in subsequent days, when the question of
the heathen marriages came to the front with Ezra
and Nehemiah. Besides, these verses 11 and 12 lack
the characteristic mark of all the other oracles of the
book: they do not state a general charge against
the people, and then introduce the people’s question
as to the particulars of the charge. On the whole,
therefore, these verses are suspicious. If not a later
intrusion, they are at least out of place where they
now lie. The peculiar remark in ver.&nbsp;13, <i>and this
secondly ye do</i>, must have been added by the editor to
whom we owe the present arrangement.</p>

<p class="captitle">FROM ZECHARIAH TO “&thinsp;MALACHI”</p>

<p class="noindent">
Between the completion of the Temple in 516
and the arrival of Ezra in 458, we have almost
no record of the little colony round Mount Zion. The
Jewish chronicles devote to the period but a few verses
of unsupported tradition.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> After 517 we have nothing
from Zechariah himself; and if any other prophet
appeared during the next half-century, his words have
not survived. We are left to infer what was the true
condition of affairs, not less from this ominous silence
than from the hints which are given to us in the
writings of “Malachi,” Ezra and Nehemiah after the
period was over. Beyond a partial attempt to rebuild
the walls of the city in the reign of Artaxerxes I.,<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> there
seems to have been nothing to record. It was a
period of disillusion, disheartening and decay. The
completion of the Temple did not bring in the Messianic
era. Zerubbabel, whom Haggai and Zechariah had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
crowned as the promised King of Israel, died without
reaching higher rank than a minor satrapy in the
Persian Empire, and even in that he appears to have
been succeeded by a Persian official.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> The re-migrations
from Babylon and elsewhere, which Zechariah predicted,
did not take place. The small population of Jerusalem
were still harassed by the hostility, and their morale
sapped by the insidiousness, of their Samaritan neighbours:
they were denied the stimulus, the purgation,
the glory of a great persecution. Their Persian tyrants
for the most part left them alone. The world left
them alone. Nothing stirred in Palestine except the
Samaritan intrigues. History rolled away westward,
and destiny seemed to be settling on the Greeks. In
490 Miltiades defeated the Persians at Marathon. In
480 Thermopylæ was fought and the Persian fleet
broken at Salamis. In 479 a Persian army was
destroyed at Platæa, and Xerxes lost Europe and
most of the Ionian coast. In 460 Athens sent an
expedition to Egypt to assist the Egyptian revolt
against Persia, and in 457 “her slain fell in Cyprus,
in Egypt, in Phœnicia, at Haliæ, in Ægina, and in
Megara in the same year.”</p>

<p>Thus severely left to themselves and to the petty
hostilities of their neighbours, the Jews appear to have
sunk into a careless and sordid manner of life. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
entered the period, it is true, with some sense of their
distinction.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> In exile they had suffered God’s anger,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>
and had been purged by it. But out of discipline often
springs pride, and there is no subtler temptation of
the human heart. The returned Israel felt this to the
quick, and it sorely unfitted them for encountering the
disappointment and hardship which followed upon
the completion of the Temple. The tide of hope,
which rose to flood with that consummation, ebbed
rapidly away, and left God’s people struggling, like
any ordinary tribe of peasants, with bad seasons and
the cruelty of their envious neighbours. Their pride
was set on edge, and they fell, not as at other periods
of disappointment into despair, but into a bitter carelessness
and a contempt of their duty to God. This
was a curious temper, and, so far as we know,
new in Israel. It led them to despise both His love
and His holiness.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> They neglected their Temple dues,
and impudently presented to their God polluted bread
and blemished beasts which they would not have dared
to offer to their Persian governor.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Like people like
priest: the priesthood lost not reverence only, but
decency and all conscience of their office.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> They
<i>despised the Table of the Lord</i>, ceased to instruct the
people and grew partial in judgment. As a consequence
they became contemptible in the eyes of the community.
Immorality prevailed among all classes: <i>every man
dealt treacherously with his brother</i>.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> Adultery, perjury,
fraud and the oppression of the poor were very rife.</p>

<p>One particular fashion, in which the people’s wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
pride spited itself, was the custom of marriage which
even the best families contracted with the half-heathen
<i>people of the land</i>. Across Judah there were scattered
the descendants of those Jews whom Nebuchadrezzar
had not deemed worth removing to Babylon. Whether
regarded from a social or a religious point of view,
their fathers had been the dregs of the old community.
Their own religion, cut off as they were from the
main body of Israel and scattered among the old
heathen shrines of the land, must have deteriorated
still further; but in all probability they had secured
for themselves the best portions of the vacant soil,
and now enjoyed a comfort and a stability of welfare
far beyond that which was yet attainable by the majority
of the returned exiles. More numerous than these
dregs of ancient Jewry were the very mixed race of
the Samaritans. They possessed a rich land, which
they had cultivated long enough for many of their
families to be settled in comparative wealth. With
all these half-pagan Jews and Samaritans, the families
of the true Israel, as they regarded themselves, did
not hesitate to form alliances, for in the precarious
position of the colony, such alliances were the surest
way both to wealth and to political influence. How
much the Jews were mastered by their desire for
them is seen from the fact that, when the relatives of
their half-heathen brides made it a condition of the
marriages that they should first put away their old
wives, they readily did so. Divorce became very
frequent, and great suffering was inflicted on the native
Jewish women.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>So the religious condition of Israel declined for nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
two generations, and then about 460 the Word of
God, after long silence, broke once more through a
prophet’s lips.</p>

<p>We call this prophet “Malachi,” following the error
of an editor of his book, who, finding it nameless,
inferred or invented that name from its description of
the priest as the “Malĕ’ach,” or <i>messenger, of the Lord
of Hosts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> But the prophet gave himself no name.
Writing from the midst of a poor and persecuted group
of the people, and attacking the authorities both of
church and state, he preferred to publish his charge
anonymously. His name was in <i>the Lord’s own book of
remembrance</i>.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<p>The unknown prophet addressed himself both to the
sinners of his people, and to those querulous adherents
of Jehovah whom the success of the sinners had
tempted to despair in their service of God. His style
shares the practical directness of his predecessors
among the returned exiles. He takes up one point
after another, and drives them home in a series of
strong, plain paragraphs of prose. But it is sixty
years since Haggai and Zechariah, and in the circumstances
we have described, a prophet could no longer
come forward as a public inspirer of his nation.
Prophecy seems to have been driven from public life,
from the sudden enforcement of truth in the face of the
people to the more deliberate and ordered argument
which marks the teacher who works in private. In the
Book of “Malachi” there are many of the principles
and much of the enthusiasm of the ancient Hebrew
seer. But the discourse is broken up into formal
paragraphs, each upon the same academic model. First
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
a truth is pronounced, or a charge made against the
people; then with the words <i>but ye will say</i> the prophet
states some possible objection of his hearers, proceeds
to answer it by detailed evidence, and only then drives
home his truth, or his charge, in genuine prophetic
fashion. To the student of prophecy this peculiarity
of the book is of the greatest interest, for it is no
merely personal idiosyncrasy. We rather feel that
prophecy is now assuming the temper of the teacher.
The method is the commencement of that which later
on becomes the prevailing habit in Jewish literature.
Just as with Zephaniah we saw prophecy passing into
Apocalypse, and with Habakkuk into the speculation
of the schools of Wisdom, so now in “Malachi” we
perceive its transformation into the scholasticism of
the Rabbis.</p>

<p>But the interest of this change of style must not
prevent us from appreciating the genuine prophetic
spirit of our book. Far more fully than, for instance,
that of Haggai, to the style of which its practical simplicity
is so akin, it enumerates the prophetic principles:
the everlasting Love of Jehovah for Israel, the Fatherhood
of Jehovah and His Holiness, His ancient Ideals
for Priesthood and People, the need of a Repentance
proved by deeds, the consequent Promise of Prosperity,
the Day of the Lord, and Judgment between the evil
and the righteous. Upon the last of these the book
affords a striking proof of the delinquency of the people
during the last half-century, and in connection with
it the prophet introduces certain novel features. To
Haggai and Zechariah the great Tribulation had closed
with the Exile and the rebuilding of the Temple:
Israel stood on the margin of the Messianic age. But
the Book of “Malachi” proclaims the need of another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
judgment as emphatically as the older prophets had
predicted the Babylonian doom. “Malachi” repeats
their name for it, <i>the great and terrible Day of Jehovah</i>.
But he does not foresee it, as they did, in the shape
of a historical process. His description of it is pure
Apocalypse—<i>the fire of the smelter and the fuller’s acid:
the day that burns like a furnace</i>, when all wickedness
is as stubble, and all evil men are devoured, but to
the righteous <i>the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with
healing in His wings</i>, and they shall tread the wicked
under foot.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> To this the prophet adds a novel promise.
God is so much the God of love,<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> that before the Day
comes He will give His people an opportunity of conversion.
He will send them Elijah the prophet to
change their hearts, that He may be prevented from
striking the land with His Ban.</p>

<p>In one other point the book is original, and that
is in its attitude towards the heathen. Among the
heathen, it boldly says, Jehovah is held in higher
reverence than among His own people.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> In such
a statement we can hardly fail to feel the influence
upon Israel of their contact, often close and personal,
with their wise and mild tyrants the Persians. We
may emphasise the verse as the first note of that
recognition of the real religiousness of the heathen,
which we shall find swelling to such fulness and
tenderness in the Book of Jonah.</p>

<p>Such are in brief the style and the principles of the
Book of “Malachi,” whose separate prophecies we may
now proceed to take up in detail.</p>

<p class="captitle">PROPHECY WITHIN THE LAW</p>

<p class="csubtitle">“M<span class="small">ALACHI</span>” i.—iv.</p>

<p>Beneath this title we may gather all the eight
sections of the Book of “Malachi.” They contain
many things of perennial interest and validity:
their truth is applicable, their music is still musical, to
ourselves. But their chief significance is historical.
They illustrate the development of prophecy <i>within</i> the
Law. Not <i>under</i> the Law, be it observed. For if one
thing be more clear than another about “Malachi’s”
teaching, it is that the spirit of prophecy is not yet
crushed by the legalism which finally killed it within
Israel. “Malachi” observes and enforces the demands
of the Deuteronomic law under which his people had
lived since the Return from Exile. But he traces
each of these to some spiritual principle, to some
essential of religion in the character of Israel’s God,
which is either doubted or neglected by his contemporaries
in their lax performance of the Law. That
is why we may entitle his book Prophecy within the
Law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The essential principles of the religion of Israel which
had been shaken or obscured by the delinquency of the
people during the half-century after the rebuilding of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
the Temple were three—the distinctive Love of Jehovah
for His people, His Holiness, and His Righteousness.
The Book of “Malachi” takes up each of these in turn,
and proves or enforces it according as the people have
formally doubted it or in their carelessness done it
despite.</p>

<h4 id="XXVIsec1">1. G<span class="small">OD’S</span>

  I<span class="small">SRAEL AND</span>
  H<span class="small">ATRED OF</span>
  E<span class="small">DOM</span><br />(Chap. i. 2–5).</h4>

<p>He begins with God’s Love, and in answer to the
disappointed<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> people’s cry, <i>Wherein hast Thou loved us?</i>
he does not, as the older prophets did, sweep the whole
history of Israel, and gather proofs of Jehovah’s grace
and unfailing guidance in all the great events from the
deliverance from Egypt to the deliverance from Babylon.
But he confines himself to a comparison of Israel with
the Gentile nation, which was most akin to Israel
according to the flesh, their own brother Edom. It is
possible, of course, to see in this a proof of our prophet’s
narrowness, as contrasted with Amos or Hosea or the
great Evangelist of the Exile. But we must remember
that out of all the history of Israel “Malachi” could not
have chosen an instance which would more strongly
appeal to the heart of his contemporaries. We have
seen from the Book of Obadiah how ever since the
beginning of the Exile Edom had come to be regarded
by Israel as their great antithesis.<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> If we needed
further proof of this we should find it in many Psalms
of the Exile, which like the Book of Obadiah remember
with bitterness the hostile part that Edom played in
the day of Israel’s calamity. The two nations were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
utterly opposed in genius and character. Edom was
a people of as unspiritual and self-sufficient a temper
as ever cursed any of God’s human creatures. Like
their ancestor they were <i>profane</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> without repentance,
humility or ideals, and almost without religion. Apart,
therefore, from the long history of war between the
two peoples, it was a true instinct which led Israel to
regard their brother as representative of that heathendom
against which they had to realise their destiny in the
world as God’s own nation. In choosing the contrast
of Edom’s fate to illustrate Jehovah’s love for Israel,
“Malachi” was not only choosing what would appeal
to the passions of his contemporaries, but what is
the most striking and constant antithesis in the whole
history of Israel: the absolutely diverse genius and
destiny of these two Semitic nations who were nearest
neighbours and, according to their traditions, twin-brethren
after the flesh. If we keep this in mind we
shall understand Paul’s use of the antithesis in the
passage in which he clenches it by a quotation from
“Malachi”: <i>as it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
have I hated</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> In these words the doctrine of the Divine
election of individuals appears to be expressed as
absolutely as possible. But it would be unfair to read
the passage except in the light of Israel’s history. In
the Old Testament it is a matter of fact that the
doctrine of the Divine preference of Israel to Esau
appeared only after the respective characters of the
nations were manifested in history, and that it grew
more defined and absolute only as history discovered
more of the fundamental contrast between the two in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
genius and destiny.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> In the Old Testament, therefore,
the doctrine is the result, not of an arbitrary belief in
God’s bare fiat, but of historical experience; although,
of course, the distinction which experience proves is
traced back, with everything else of good or evil that
happens, to the sovereign will and purpose of God.
Nor let us forget that the Old Testament doctrine of
election is of election to service only. That is to say,
the Divine intention in electing covers not the elect
individual or nation only, but the whole world and its
needs of God and His truth.</p>

<p>The event to which “Malachi” appeals as evidence
for God’s rejection of Edom is <i>the desolation</i> of the
latter’s ancient <i>heritage</i>, <i>and</i> the abandonment of it
to the <i>jackals of the desert</i>. Scholars used to think
that these vague phrases referred to some act of the
Persian kings: some removal of the Edomites from
the lands of the Jews in order to make room for the
returned exiles.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> But “Malachi” says expressly that
it was Edom’s own <i>heritage</i> which was laid desolate.
This can only be Mount Esau or Se’ir, and the statement
that it was delivered <i>to the jackals of the desert</i>
proves that the reference is to that same expulsion of
Edom from their territory by the Nabatean Arabs
which we have already seen the Book of Obadiah
relate about the beginning of the Exile.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
But it is now time to give in full the opening
passage of “Malachi,” in which he appeals to this
important event as proof of God’s distinctive love for
Israel, and, “Malachi” adds, of His power beyond
Israel’s border (“Mal.” chap. i. 2–5).</p>

<p><i>I have loved you, saith Jehovah. But ye say,
“Wherein hast Thou loved us?” Is not Esau brother
to Jacob?—oracle of Jehovah—and I have loved Jacob and
Esau have I hated. I have made his mountains desolate,
and given his heritage to the jackals of the desert. Should
</i>the people of<i> Edom say,<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> “We are destroyed, but we
will rebuild the waste places,” thus saith Jehovah of
Hosts, They may build, but I will pull down: men shall
call them “The Border of Wickedness” and “The People
with whom Jehovah is wroth for ever.” And your eyes
shall see it, and yourselves shall say, “Great is Jehovah
beyond Israel’s border.”</i></p>

<h4 id="XXVIsec2">2. “H<span class="small">ONOUR</span>
 T<span class="small">HY</span> F<span class="small">ATHER</span>”
 (Chap. i. 6–14).</h4>

<p>From God’s Love, which Israel have doubted, the
prophet passes to His Majesty or Holiness, which they
have wronged. Now it is very remarkable that the
relation of God to the Jews in which the prophet
should see His Majesty illustrated is not only His
lordship over them but His Fatherhood: <i>A son honours
a father, and a servant his lord; but if I be Father,
where is My honour? and if I be Lord, where is there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
reverence for Me? saith Jehovah of Hosts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> We are
so accustomed to associate with the Divine Fatherhood
only ideas of love and pity that the use of the relation
to illustrate not love but Majesty, and the setting of it in
parallel to the Divine Kingship, may seem to us strange.
Yet this was very natural to Israel. In the old Semitic
world, even to the human parent, honour was due before
love. <i>Honour thy father and thy mother</i>, said the Fifth
Commandment; and when, after long shyness to do
so, Israel at last ventured to claim Jehovah as the
Father of His people, it was at first rather with the
view of increasing their sense of His authority and
their duty of reverencing Him, than with the view of
bringing Him near to their hearts and assuring them
of His tenderness. The latter elements, it is true,
were not absent from the conception. But even in
the Psalter, in which we find the most intimate and
tender fellowship of the believer with God, there is
only one passage in which His love for His own is
compared to the love of a human father.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> And in
the other very few passages of the Old Testament
where He is revealed or appealed to as the Father
of the nation, it is, with two exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> in order
either to emphasise His creation of Israel or His discipline.
So in Jeremiah,<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> and in an anonymous prophet
of the same period perhaps as “Malachi.”<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> This
hesitation to ascribe to God the name of Father, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
this severe conception of what Fatherhood meant, was
perhaps needful for Israel in face of the sensuous
ideas of the Divine Fatherhood cherished by their
heathen neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> But, however this may be, the
infrequency and austerity of Israel’s conception of
God’s Fatherhood, in contrast with that of Christianity,
enables us to understand why “Malachi” should
employ the relation as proof, not of the Love, but of
the Majesty and Holiness of Jehovah.</p>

<p>This Majesty and this Holiness have been wronged,
he says, by low thoughts of God’s altar, and by offering
upon it, with untroubled conscience, cheap and blemished
sacrifices. The people would have been ashamed
to present such to their Persian governor: how can
God be pleased with them? Better that sacrifice
should cease than that such offerings should be
presented in such a spirit! <i>Is there no one</i>, cries the
prophet, <i>to close the doors</i> of the Temple altogether, so
that <i>the altar</i> smoke not <i>in vain</i>?</p>

<p>The passage shows us what a change has passed
over the spirit of Israel since prophecy first attacked
the sacrificial ritual. We remember how Amos would
have swept it all away as an abomination to God.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>
So, too, Isaiah and Jeremiah. But their reason for
this was very different from “Malachi’s.” Their
contemporaries were assiduous and lavish in sacrificing,
and were devoted to the Temple and the ritual with
a fanaticism which made them forget that Jehovah’s
demands upon His people were righteousness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the service of the weak. But “Malachi” condemns
his generation for depreciating the Temple, and
for being stingy and fraudulent in their offerings.
Certainly the post-exilic prophet assumes a different
attitude to the ritual from that of his predecessors in
ancient Israel. They wished it all abolished, and
placed the chief duties of Israel towards God in civic
justice and mercy. But he emphasises it as the first
duty of the people towards God, and sees in their
neglect the reason of their misfortunes and the cause
of their coming doom. In this change which has
come over prophecy we must admit the growing
influence of the Law. From Ezekiel onwards the
prophets become more ecclesiastical and legal. And
though at first they do not become less ethical, yet
the influence which was at work upon them was of
such a character as was bound in time to engross
their interest, and lead them to remit the ethical
elements of their religion to a place secondary to
the ceremonial. We see symptoms of this even in
“Malachi,” we shall find more in Joel, and we know
how aggravated these symptoms afterwards became
in all the leaders of Jewish religion. At the same
time we ought to remember that this change of
emphasis, which many will think to be for the worse,
was largely rendered necessary by the change of
temper in the people to whom the prophets ministered.
“Malachi” found among his contemporaries a habit of
religious performance which was not only slovenly and
indecent, but mean and fraudulent, and it became his
first practical duty to attack this. Moreover the neglect
of the Temple was not due to those spiritual conceptions
of Jehovah and those moral duties He demanded,
in the interests of which the older prophets had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
condemned the ritual. At bottom the neglect of the
Temple was due to the very same reasons as the
superstitious zeal and fanaticism in sacrificing which
the older prophets had attacked—false ideas, namely,
of God Himself, and of what was due to Him from
His people. And on these grounds, therefore, we may
say that “Malachi” was performing for his generation
as needful and as Divine a work as Amos and Isaiah
had performed for theirs. Only, be it admitted, the
direction of “Malachi’s” emphasis was more dangerous
for religion than that of the emphasis of Amos or
Isaiah. How liable the practice he inculcated was to
exaggeration and abuse is sadly proved in the later
history of his people: it was against that exaggeration,
grown great and obdurate through three centuries, that
Jesus delivered His most unsparing words.</p>

<p>Before we pass from this passage we must notice in it
one very remarkable feature—perhaps the most original
contribution which the Book of “Malachi” makes
to the development of prophecy. In contrast to the
irreverence of Israel and the wrong they do to
Jehovah’s Holiness, He Himself asserts that not only
is <i>His Name great and glorified among the heathen, from
the rising to the setting of the sun</i>, but that <i>in every
sacred place incense and a pure offering are offered to
His Name</i>. This is so novel a statement, and, we may
truly say, so startling, that it is not wonderful that
the attempt should have been made to interpret it, not
of the prophet’s own day, but of the Messianic age
and the kingdom of Christ. So, many of the Christian
Fathers, from Justin and Irenæus to Theodoret and
Augustine;<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> so, our own Authorised Version, which
boldly throws the verbs into the future; and so, many
modern interpreters like Pusey, who declares that the
style is “a vivid present such as is often used to
describe the future; but the things spoken of show it
to be future.” All these take the passage to be an
anticipation of Christ’s parables declaring the rejection
of the Jews and ingathering of the Gentiles to the
kingdom of heaven, and of the argument of the Epistle
to the Hebrews, that the bleeding and defective offerings
of the Jews were abrogated by the sacrifice of the
Cross. But such an exegesis is only possible by
perverting the text and misreading the whole argument
of the prophet. Not only are the verbs of the original
in the present tense—so also in the early versions—but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the prophet is obviously contrasting the contempt
of God’s own people for Himself and His institutions
with the reverence paid to His Name among the
heathen. It is not the mere question of there being
righteous people in every nation, well-pleasing to
Jehovah because of their lives. The very sacrifices of
the heathen are pure and acceptable to Him. Never
have we had in prophecy, even the most far-seeing and
evangelical, a statement so generous and so catholic as
this. Why it should appear only now in the history
of prophecy is a question we are unable to answer with
certainty. Many have seen in it the result of Israel’s
intercourse with their tolerant and religious masters
the Persians. None of the Persian kings had up to
this time persecuted the Jews, and numbers of pious
and large-minded Israelites must have had opportunity
of acquaintance with the very pure doctrines of the
Persian religion, among which it is said that there
was already numbered the recognition of true piety in
men of all religions.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> If Paul derived from his Hellenic
culture the knowledge which made it possible for him
to speak as he did in Athens of the religiousness of
the Gentiles, it was just as probable that Jews who had
come within the experience of a still purer Aryan
faith should utter an even more emphatic acknowledgment
that the One True God had those who
served Him in spirit and in truth all over the world.
But, whatever foreign influences may have ripened
such a faith in Israel, we must not forget that its
roots were struck deep in the native soil of their
religion. From the first they had known their God as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
a God of a grace so infinite that it was impossible it
should be exhausted on themselves. If His righteousness,
as Amos showed, was over all the Syrian states,
and His pity and His power to convert, as Isaiah
showed, covered even the cities of Phœnicia, the great
Evangelist of the Exile could declare that He quenched
not the smoking wicks of the dim heathen faiths.</p>

<p>As interesting, however, as the origin of “Malachi’s”
attitude to the heathen, are two other points about it.
In the first place, it is remarkable that it should
occur, especially in the form of emphasising the purity
of heathen sacrifices, in a book which lays such
heavy stress upon the Jewish Temple and ritual. This
is a warning to us not to judge harshly the so-called
legal age of Jewish religion, nor to despise the
prophets who have come under the influence of the
Law. And in the second place, we perceive in this
statement a step towards the fuller acknowledgment
of Gentile religiousness which we find in the Book
of Jonah. It is strange that none of the post-exilic
Psalms strike the same note. They often predict the
conversion of the heathen; but they do not recognise
their native reverence and piety. Perhaps the reason
is that in a body of song, collected for the national
service, such a feature would be out of place.</p>

<p>In the third section of his book “Malachi” addresses
himself to the priests. He charges them not only
with irreverence and slovenliness in their discharge
of the Temple service—for this he appears to intend
by the phrase <i>filth of your feasts</i>—but with the neglect
of their intellectual duties to the people. <i>The lips of
a priest guard knowledge, and men seek instruction from
his mouth, for he is the Angel</i>—the revealing Angel—<i>of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Jehovah of Hosts</i>. Once more, what a remarkable
saying to come from the legal age of Israel’s religion,
and from a writer who so emphasises the ceremonial
law! In all the range of prophecy there is not any
more in harmony with the prophetic ideal. How
needed it is in our own age!—needed against those two
extremes of religion from which we suffer, the limitation
of the ideal of priesthood to the communication of a
magic grace, and its evaporation in a vague religiosity
from which the intellect is excluded as if it were perilous,
worldly and devilish.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> “Surrender of the intellect”
indeed! This is the burial of the talent in the napkin,
and, as in the parable of Christ, it is still in our day
preached and practised by the men of one talent.
Religion needs all the brains we poor mortals can put
into it. There is a priesthood of knowledge, a priesthood
of the intellect, says “Malachi,” and he makes this
a large part of God’s covenant with Levi. Every priest
of God is a priest of truth; and it is very largely
by the Christian ministry’s neglect of their intellectual
duties that so much irreligion prevails. As in
“Malachi’s” day, so now, “the laity take hurt and
hindrance by our negligence.”<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> And just as he points
out, so with ourselves, the consequence is the growing
indifference with which large bodies of the Christian
ministry are regarded by the thoughtful portions both
of our labouring and professional classes. Were the
ministers of all the Churches to awake to their ideal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
in this matter, there would surely come a very great
revival of religion among us.</p>

<p>In his fourth section, upon his countrymen’s frequent
divorce of their native wives in order to marry into the
influential families of their half-heathen neighbours,<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>
“Malachi” makes another of those wide and spiritual
utterances which so distinguish his prophecy and
redeem his age from the charge of legalism that is so
often brought against it. To him the Fatherhood of
God is not merely a relation of power and authority,
requiring reverence from the nation. It constitutes
the members of the nation one close brotherhood, and
against this divorce is a crime and unnatural cruelty.
Jehovah makes the <i>wife of a man’s youth his mate</i> for
life <i>and his wife by covenant</i>. He <i>hates divorce</i>, and
His altar is so wetted by the tears of the wronged
women of Israel that the gifts upon it are no more
acceptable in His sight. No higher word on marriage
was spoken except by Christ Himself. It breathes
the spirit of our Lord’s utterance: if we were sure of
the text of ver.&nbsp;15, we might almost say that it anticipated
the letter. Certain verses, 11–13<i>a</i>, which disturb
the argument by bringing in the marriages with heathen
wives are omitted in the following translation, and will
be given separately.</p>

<p><i>Have we not all One Father? Hath not One God

<p>The verses omitted in the above translation treat
of the foreign marriages, which led to this frequent
divorce by the Jews of their native wives. So far, of
course, they are relevant to the subject of the passage.
But they obviously disturb its argument, as already
pointed out.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> They have nothing to do with the
principle from which it starts that Jehovah is the Father
of the whole of Israel. Remove them and the awkward
clause in ver.&nbsp;13<i>a</i>, by which some editor has tried to
connect them with the rest of the paragraph, and
the latter runs smoothly. The motive of their later
addition is apparent, if not justifiable. Here they are
by themselves:—</p>

<p>In this section “Malachi” turns from the sinners
of his people to those who weary Jehovah with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
complaint that sin is successful, or, as they put it,
<i>Every one that does evil is good in the eyes of Jehovah,
and He delighteth in them</i>; and again, <i>Where is the
God of Judgment?</i> The answer is, The Lord Himself
shall come. His Angel shall prepare His way before
Him, and suddenly shall the Lord come to His Temple.
His coming shall be for judgment, terrible and
searching. Its first object (note the order) shall be
the cleansing of the priesthood, that proper sacrifices
may be established, and its second the purging of the
immorality of the people. Mark that although the
coming of the Angel is said to precede that of Jehovah
Himself, there is the same blending of the two as
we have seen in previous accounts of angels.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> It is
uncertain whether this section closes with ver.&nbsp;5 or 6:
the latter goes equally well with it and with the
following section.</p>

<p><i>Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words; and ye
say, “In what have we wearied</i> Him <i>?” In that ye say,
“Every one that does evil is good in the eyes of Jehovah,
and He delighteth in them”; or else, “Where is the God
of Judgment?” Behold, I will send My Angel, to
prepare the way before Me, and suddenly shall come to
His Temple the Lord whom ye seek and the Angel of
the Covenant whom ye desire. Behold, He comes! saith
Jehovah of Hosts. But who may bear the day of His
coming, and who stand when He appears? For He is
like the fire of the smelter and the acid of the fullers. He
takes His seat to smelt and to purge;<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> and He will purge
the sons of Levi, and wash them out like gold or silver,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
and they shall be to Jehovah bringers of an offering in
righteousness. And the offering of Judah and Jerusalem
shall be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old and
as in long past years. And I will come near you to
judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the
sorcerers and the adulterers and the perjurers, and
against those who wrong the hireling in his wage, and
the widow and the orphan, and oppress the stranger,
and fear not Me, saith Jehovah of Hosts.</i></p>

<p>This section ought perhaps to follow on to the
preceding. Those whom it blames for not paying
the Temple tithes may be the sceptics addressed in
the previous section, who have stopped their dues
to Jehovah out of sheer disappointment that He does
nothing. And ver.&nbsp;6, which goes well with either
section, may be the joint between the two. However
this be, the new section enforces the need of the
people’s repentance and return to God, if He is to
return to them. And when they ask, how are they
to return, “Malachi” plainly answers, By the payment
of the tithes they have not paid. In withholding
these they robbed God, and to this, their crime,
are due the locusts and bad seasons which have
afflicted them. In our temptation to see in this a
purely legal spirit, let us remember that the neglect
to pay the tithes was due to a religious cause, unbelief
in Jehovah, and that the return to belief in Him could
not therefore be shown in a more practical way than
by the payment of tithes. This is not prophecy subject
to the Law, but prophecy employing the means and
vehicles of grace with which the Law at that time
provided the people.</p>

<p>This is another charge to the doubters among the
pious remnant of Israel, who, seeing the success of
the wicked, said it is vain to serve God. Deuteronomy
was their Canon, and Deuteronomy said that if men
sinned they decayed, if they were righteous they prospered.
How different were the facts of experience!
The evil men succeeded: the good won no gain by
their goodness, nor did their mourning for the sins of
their people work any effect. Bitterest of all, they
had to congratulate wickedness in high places, and
Jehovah Himself suffered it to go unpunished. <i>Such
things</i>, says “Malachi,” <i>spake they that feared God to
each other</i>—tempted thereto by the dogmatic form of
their religion, and forgetful of all that Jeremiah and
the Evangelist of the Exile had taught them of the
value of righteous sufferings. Nor does “Malachi”
remind them of this. His message is that the Lord
remembers them, has their names written before Him,
and when the day of His action comes they shall be
separated from the wicked and spared. This is simply
to transfer the fulfilment of the promise of Deuteronomy
to the future and to another dispensation. Prophecy
still works within the Law.</p>

<p>The Apocalypse of this last judgment is one of the
grandest in all Scripture. To the wicked it shall be
a terrible fire, root and branch shall they be burned
out, but to the righteous a fair morning of God, as
when dawn comes to those who have been sick and
sleepless through the black night, and its beams bring
healing, even as to the popular belief of Israel it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the rays of the morning sun which distilled the dew.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>
They break into life and energy, like young calves
leaping from the dark pen into the early sunshine.
To this morning landscape a grim figure is added.
They shall tread down the wicked and the arrogant
like ashes beneath their feet.</p>

<p><i>Your words are hard upon Me, saith Jehovah. Ye
say, “What have we said against Thee?” Ye have said,
“It is vain to serve God,” and “What gain is it to us to
have kept His charge, or to have walked in funeral garb
before Jehovah of Hosts? Even now we have got to
congratulate the arrogant; yea, the workers of wickedness
are fortified; yea, they tempt God and escape!” Such
things<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> spake they that fear Jehovah to each other. But

Him.</i></p>

<p>With his last word the prophet significantly calls
upon the people to remember the Law. This is their
one hope before the coming of the great and terrible
day of the Lord. But, in order that the Law may have
full effect, Prophecy will be sent to bring it home to
the hearts of the people—Prophecy in the person of
her founder and most drastic representative. Nothing
could better gather up than this conjunction does
that mingling of Law and of Prophecy which we have
seen to be so characteristic of the work of “Malachi.”
Only we must not overlook the fact that “Malachi”
expects this prophecy, which with the Law is to work
the conversion of the people, not in the continuance of
the prophetic succession by the appearance of original
personalities, developing further the great principles
of their order, but in the return of the first prophet
Elijah. This is surely the confession of Prophecy that
the number of her servants is exhausted and her message
to Israel fulfilled. She can now do no more for the
people than she has done. But she will summon up
her old energy and fire in the return of her most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
powerful personality, and make one grand effort to
convert the nation before the Lord come and strike
it with judgment.</p>

<p><i>Remember the Torah of Moses, My servant, with
which I charged him in Horeb for all Israel: statutes
and judgments. Lo! I am sending to you Elijah the
prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day
of Jehovah. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers
to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, ere
I come and strike the land with the Ban.</i></p>

<p class="thb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Malachi” makes this promise of the Law in the
dialect of Deuteronomy: <i>statutes and judgments with
which Jehovah charged Moses for Israel</i>. But the Law
he enforces is not that which God delivered to Moses
on the plains of Shittim, but that which He gave him
in Mount Horeb. And so it came to pass. In a
very few years after “Malachi” prophesied Ezra the
Scribe brought from Babylon the great Levitical Code,
which appears to have been arranged there, while the
colony in Jerusalem were still organising their life under
the Deuteronomic legislation. In 444 <span class="small">B.C.</span> this Levitical
Code, along with Deuteronomy, became by covenant
between the people and their God their Canon and
Law. And in the next of our prophets, Joel, we shall
find its full influence at work.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF JOEL</p>

<p class="noindent">
In the criticism of the Book of Joel there exist
differences of opinion—upon its date, the exact
reference of its statements and its relation to parallel
passages in other prophets—as wide as even those by
which the Book of Obadiah has been assigned to every
century between the tenth and the fourth before Christ.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>
As in the case of Obadiah, the problem is not entangled
with any doctrinal issue or question of accuracy; but
while we saw that Obadiah was not involved in the
central controversy of the Old Testament, the date of
the Law, not a little in Joel turns upon the latter.
And, besides, certain descriptions raise the large question
between a literal and an allegorical interpretation.
Thus the Book of Joel carries the student further into
the problems of Old Testament Criticism, and forms
an even more excellent introduction to the latter, than
does the Book of Obadiah.</p>

<h4 id="XXVIIsec1">1. T<span class="small">HE</span>
  D<span class="small">ATE OF THE</span>
  B<span class="small">OOK</span>.</h4>

<p>In the history of prophecy the Book of Joel must
be either very early or very late, and with few exceptions
the leading critics place it either before 800 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
or after 500. So great a difference is due to most
substantial reasons. Unlike every other prophet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
except Haggai, “Malachi” and “Zechariah” ix.—xiv.,
Joel mentions neither Assyria, which emerged upon
the prophetic horizon about 760,<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> nor the Babylonian
Empire, which had fallen by 537. The presumption
is that he wrote before 760 or after 537. Unlike
all the prophets, too,<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> Joel does not charge his
people with civic or national sins; nor does his book
bear any trace of the struggle between the righteous
and unrighteous in Israel, nor of that between the
spiritual worshippers of Jehovah and the idolaters.
The book addresses an undivided nation, who know no
God but Jehovah; and again the presumption is that
Joel wrote before Amos and his successors had started
the spiritual antagonisms which rent Israel in twain,
or after the Law had been accepted by the whole people
under Nehemiah.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> The same wide alternative is suggested
by the style and phraseology. Joel’s Hebrew
is simple and direct. Either he is an early writer, or
imitates early writers. His book contains a number of
phrases and verses identical, or nearly identical, with
those of prophets from Amos to “Malachi.” Either they
all borrowed from Joel, or he borrowed from them.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>Of this alternative modern criticism at first preferred
the earlier solution, and dated Joel before Amos. So
Credner in his Commentary in 1831, and following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
him Hitzig, Bleek, Ewald, Delitzsch, Keil, Kuenen
(up to 1864),<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Pusey and others. So, too, at first
some living critics of the first rank, who, like Kuenen,
have since changed their opinion. And so, even still,
Kirkpatrick (on the whole), Von Orelli, Robertson,<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a>
Stanley Leathes and Sinker.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> The reasons which
these scholars have given for the early date of Joel
are roughly as follows.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> His book occurs among the
earliest of the Twelve: while it is recognised that the
order of these is not strictly chronological, it is alleged
that there is a division between the pre-exilic and post-exilic
prophets, and that Joel is found among the former.
The vagueness of his representations in general, and
of his pictures of the Day of Jehovah in particular, is
attributed to the simplicity of the earlier religion of
Israel, and to the want of that analysis of its leading
conceptions which was the work of later prophets.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
His horror of the interruption of the daily offerings
in the Temple, caused by the plague of locusts,<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>
is ascribed to a fear which pervaded the primitive
ages of all peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> In Joel’s attitude towards other
nations, whom he condemns to judgment, Ewald saw
“the old unsubdued warlike spirit of the times of
Deborah and David.” The prophet’s absorption in the
ravages of the locusts is held to reflect the feeling of
a purely agricultural community, such as Israel was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
before the eighth century. The absence of the name
of Assyria from the book is assigned to the same unwillingness
to give the name as we see in Amos and the
earlier prophecies of Isaiah, and it is thought by some
that, though not named, the Assyrians are symbolised
by the locusts. The absence of all mention of the Law
is also held by some to prove an early date: though
other critics, who believe that the Levitical legislation
was extant in Israel from the earliest times, find proof
of this in Joel’s insistence upon the daily offering. The
absence of all mention of a king and the prominence
given to the priests are explained by assigning the
prophecy to the minority of King Joash of Judah, when
Jehoyada the priest was regent;<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> the charge against
Egypt and Edom of spilling innocent blood by Shishak’s
invasion of Judah,<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> and by the revolt of the Edomites
under Jehoram;<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> the charge against the Philistines and
Phœnicians by the Chronicler’s account of Philistine
raids<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> in the reign of Jehoram of Judah, and by the
oracles of Amos against both nations;<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> and the mention
of the Vale of Jehoshaphat by that king’s defeat of
Moab, Ammon and Edom in the Vale of Berakhah.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>
These allusions being recognised, it was deduced from
them that the parallels between Joel and Amos were
due to Amos having quoted from Joel.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
These reasons are not all equally cogent,<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> and even
the strongest of them do not prove more than the
possibility of an early date for Joel.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> Nor do they
meet every historical difficulty. The minority of Joash,
upon which they converge, fell at a time when Aram
was not only prominent to the thoughts of Israel, but
had already been felt to be an enemy as powerful
as the Philistines or Edomites. But the Book of Joel
does not mention Aram. It mentions the Greeks,<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> and,
although we have no right to say that such a notice
was impossible in Israel in the ninth century, it was
not only improbable, but no other Hebrew document
from before the Exile speaks of Greece, and in particular
Amos does not when describing the Phœnicians as
slave-traders.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> The argument that the Book of Joel
must be early because it was placed among the first six of
the Twelve Prophets by the arrangers of the Prophetic
Canon, who could not have forgotten Joel’s date had he
lived after 450, loses all force from the fact that in the
same group of pre-exilic prophets we find the exilic
Obadiah and the post-exilic Jonah, both of them in
precedence to Micah.</p>

<p>The argument for the early date of Joel is, therefore,
not conclusive. But there are besides serious objections
to it, which make for the other solution of the alternative
we started from, and lead us to place Joel after
the establishment of the Law by Ezra and Nehemiah
in 444 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
A post-exilic date was first proposed by Vatke,<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> and
then defended by Hilgenfeld,<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> and by Duhm in 1875.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>
From this time the theory made rapid way, winning
over many who had previously held the early date of
Joel, like Oort,<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> Kuenen,<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> A.

Nowack.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> The reasons which have led to this formidable
change of opinion in favour of the late date of the
Book of Joel are as follows.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Exile of Judah appears in it
as already past. This is proved, not by the ambiguous
phrase, <i>when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
and Jerusalem</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> but by the plain statement that <i>the
heathen have scattered Israel among the nations and divided
their land</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> The plunder of the Temple seems also to
be implied.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> Moreover, no great world-power is pictured
as either threatening or actually persecuting God’s
people; but Israel’s active enemies and enslavers are
represented as her own neighbours, Edomites, Philistines
and Phœnicians, and the last are represented as
selling Jewish captives to the Greeks. All this suits,
if it does not absolutely prove, the Persian age, before
the reign of Artaxerxes Ochus, who was the first Persian
king to treat the Jews with cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> The Greeks,
Javan, do not appear in any Hebrew writer before the
Exile;<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> the form in which their name is given by Joel,
B’ne ha-Jevanim, has admittedly a late sound about it,<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>
and we know from other sources that it was in the
fifth and fourth centuries that Syrian slaves were in
demand in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> Similarly with the internal condition
of the Jews as reflected in Joel. No king is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
mentioned; but the priests are prominent, and the elders
are introduced at least once.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> It is an agricultural
calamity, and that alone, unmixed with any political
alarm, which is the omen of the coming Day of the
Lord. All this suits the state of Jerusalem under the
Persians. Take again the religious temper and emphasis
of the book. The latter is laid, as we have seen, very
remarkably upon the horror of the interruption by the
plague of locusts of the daily meal and drink offerings,
and in the later history of Israel the proofs are many
of the exceeding importance with which the regularity
of this was regarded.<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> This, says Professor A. B.
Davidson, “is very unlike the way in which all other
prophets down to Jeremiah speak of the sacrificial
service.” The priests, too, are called to take the initiative;
and the summons to a solemn and formal fast,
without any notice of the particular sins of the people
or exhortations to distinct virtues, contrasts with the
attitude to fasts of the earlier prophets, and with their
insistence upon a change of life as the only acceptable
form of penitence.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> And another contrast with the
earliest prophets is seen in the general apocalyptic
atmosphere and colouring of the Book of Joel, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
as in some of the particular figures in which this is
expressed, and which are derived from later prophets
like Zephaniah and Ezekiel.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>These evidences for a late date are supported, on
the whole, by the language of the book. Of this Merx
furnishes many details, and by a careful examination,
which makes due allowance for the poetic form of the
book and for possible glosses, Holzinger has shown
that there are symptoms in vocabulary, grammar and
syntax which at least are more reconcilable with a late
than with an early date.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> There are a number of
Aramaic words, of Hebrew words used in the sense
in which they are used by Aramaic, but by no other
Hebrew, writers, and several terms and constructions
which appear only in the later books of the Old
Testament or very seldom in the early ones.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> It is
true that these do not stand in a large proportion to
the rest of Joel’s vocabulary and grammar, which is
classic and suitable to an early period of the literature;
but this may be accounted for by the large use which
the prophet makes of the very words of earlier writers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Take this large use into account, and the unmistakable
Aramaisms of the book become even more emphatic
in their proof of a late date.</p>

<p>The literary parallels between Joel and other writers
are unusually many for so small a book. They number
at least twenty in seventy-two verses. The other
books of the Old Testament in which they occur are
about twelve. Where one writer has parallels with
many, we do not necessarily conclude that he is the
borrower, unless we find that some of the phrases
common to both are characteristic of the other writers,
or that, in his text of them, there are differences from
theirs which may reasonably be reckoned to be of
a later origin. But that both of these conditions are
found in the parallels between Joel and other prophets
has been shown by Prof. Driver and Mr. G. B. Gray.
“Several of the parallels—either in their entirety or
by virtue of certain words which they contain—have
their affinities solely or chiefly in the later writings.
But the significance [of this] is increased when the
very difference between a passage in Joel and its
parallel in another book consists in a word or phrase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
characteristic of the later centuries. That a passage
in a writer of the ninth century should differ from its
parallel in a subsequent writer by the presence of a
word elsewhere confined to the later literature would
be strange; a single instance would not, indeed, be
inexplicable in view of the scantiness of extant writings;
but every additional instance—though itself not very
convincing—renders the strangeness greater.” And
again, “the variations in some of the parallels as found
in Joel have other common peculiarities. This also
finds its natural explanation in the fact that Joel quotes:
for that the <i>same</i> author even when quoting from
different sources should quote with variations of the
same character is natural, but that <i>different</i> authors
quoting from a common source should follow the same
method of quotation is improbable.”<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> “While in some
of the parallels a comparison discloses indications that
the phrase in Joel is probably the later, in other cases,
even though the expression may in itself be met with
earlier, it becomes frequent only in a later age, and the
use of it by Joel increases the presumption that he
stands by the side of the later writers.”<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>In face of so many converging lines of evidence, we
shall not wonder that there should have come about
so great a change in the opinion of the majority of
critics on the date of Joel, and that it should now be
assigned by them to a post-exilic date. Some place
it in the sixth century before Christ,<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> some in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>half of the fifth before “Malachi” and Nehemiah,<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> but
the most after the full establishment of the Law by
Ezra and Nehemiah in 444 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> It is difficult, perhaps
impossible, to decide. Nothing certain can be deduced
from the mention of the <i>city wall</i> in chap. ii. 9, from
which Robertson Smith and Cornill infer that Nehemiah’s
walls were already built. Nor can we be sure that
Joel quotes the phrase, <i>before the great and terrible day
of Jehovah come</i>, from “Malachi,”<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> although this is rendered
probable by the character of Joel’s other parallels.
But the absence of all reference to the prophets as
a class, the promise of the rigorous exclusion of
foreigners from Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> the condemnation to judgment
of all the heathen, and the strong apocalyptic
character of the book, would incline us to place it after
Ezra rather than before. How far after, it is impossible
to say, but the absence of feeling against Persia requires
a date before the cruelties inflicted by Artaxerxes
about 360.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
One solution, which has lately been offered for the
problems of date presented by the Book of Joel, deserves
some notice. In his German translation of Driver’s
<i>Introduction to the Old Testament</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> Rothstein questions
the integrity of the prophecy, and alleges reasons for
dividing it into two sections. Chaps. i. and ii. (Heb.;
i.—ii. 27 Eng.) he assigns to an early author, writing
in the minority of King Joash, but chaps. iii. and iv.
(Heb.; ii. 28—iii. Eng.) to a date after the Exile, while
ii. 20, which, it will be remembered, Robertson Smith
takes as a gloss, he attributes to the editor who has
joined the two sections together. His reasons are
that chaps. i. and ii. are entirely taken up with the
physical plague of locusts, and no troubles from heathen
are mentioned; while chaps. iii. and iv. say nothing
of a physical plague, but the evils they deplore for
Israel are entirely political, the assaults of enemies.
Now it is quite within the bounds of possibility that
chaps. iii. and iv. are from another hand than chaps. i.
and ii.: we have nothing to disprove that. But, on the
other hand, there is nothing to prove it. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
contrary, the possibility of all four chapters being from
the same hand is very obvious. Joel mentions no
heathen in the first chapter, because he is engrossed
with the plague of locusts. But when this has passed,
it is quite natural that he should take up the standing
problem of Israel’s history—their relation to heathen
peoples. There is no discrepancy between the two
different subjects, nor between the styles in which they
are respectively treated. Rothstein’s arguments for an
early date for chaps. i. and ii. have been already
answered, and when we come to the exposition of them
we shall find still stronger reasons for assigning them
to the end of the fifth century before Christ. The
assault on the integrity of the prophecy may therefore
be said to have failed, though no one who remembers
the composite character of the prophetical books can
deny that the question is still open.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a></p>

<p>Another question to which we must address ourselves
before we can pass to the exposition of Joel’s
prophecies is of the attitude and intention of the
prophet. Does he describe or predict? Does he
give history or allegory?</p>

<p>Joel starts from a great plague of locusts, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
describes not only in the ravages they commit upon
the land, but in their ominous foreshadowing of the
Day of the Lord. They are the heralds of God’s near
judgment upon the nation. Let the latter repent
instantly with a day of fasting and prayer. Peradventure
Jehovah will relent, and spare His people.
So far chap. i. 2—ii. 17. Then comes a break. An
uncertain interval appears to elapse; and in chap.
ii. 18 we are told that Jehovah’s zeal for Israel has
been stirred, and He has had pity on His folk. Promises
follow, <i>first</i>, of deliverance from the plague and
of restoration of the harvests it has consumed, and
<i>second</i>, of the outpouring of the Spirit on all classes
of the community: chap. ii. 17–32 (Eng.; ii. 17—iii.
Heb.). Chap. iii. (Eng.; iv. Heb.) gives another picture
of the Day of Jehovah, this time described as a
judgment upon the heathen enemies of Israel. They
shall be brought together, condemned judicially by
Him, and slain by His hosts, His “supernatural” hosts.
Jerusalem shall be freed from the feet of strangers, and
the fertility of the land restored.</p>

<p>These are the contents of the book. Do they
describe an actual plague of locusts, already experienced
by the people? Or do they predict this as still
to come? And again, are the locusts which they
describe real locusts, or a symbol and allegory of the
human foes of Israel? To these two questions, which
in a measure cross and involve each other, three
kinds of answer have been given.</p>

<p>A large and growing majority of critics of all
schools<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> hold that Joel starts, like other prophets, from
the facts of experience. His locusts, though described
with poetic hyperbole—for are they not the vanguard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
of the awful Day of God’s judgment?—are real locusts;
their plague has just been felt by his contemporaries,
whom he summons to repent, and to whom, when they
have repented, he brings promises of the restoration
of their ruined harvests, the outpouring of the Spirit,
and judgment upon their foes. Prediction is therefore
found only in the second half of the book (ii. 18
onwards): it rests upon a basis of narrative and exhortation
which fills the first half.</p>

<p>But a number of other critics have argued (and
with great force) that the prophet’s language about the
locusts is too aggravated and too ominous to be limited
to the natural plague which these insects periodically
inflicted upon Palestine. Joel (they reason) would
hardly have connected so common an adversity with
so singular and ultimate a crisis as the Day of the
Lord. Under the figure of locusts he must be
describing some more fateful agency of God’s wrath
upon Israel. More than one trait of his description
appears to imply a human army. It can only be one
or other, or all, of those heathen powers whom at
different periods God raised up to chastise His
delinquent people; and this opinion is held to be supported
by the facts that chap. ii. 20 speaks of them
as the Northern and chap. iii. (Eng.; iv. Heb.) deals
with the heathen. The locusts of chaps. i. and ii.
are the same as the heathen of chap. iii. In chaps.
i. and ii. they are described as threatening Israel,
but on condition of Israel repenting (chap. ii. 18 ff.)
the Day of the Lord which they herald shall be their
destruction and not Israel’s (chap. iii.).<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
The supporters of this allegorical interpretation of
Joel are, however, divided among themselves as to
whether the heathen powers symbolised by the locusts
are described as having already afflicted Israel or are
predicted as still to come. Hilgenfeld,<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> for instance,
says that the prophet in chaps. i. and ii. speaks of
their ravages as already past. To him their fourfold
plague described in chap. i. 4 symbolises four Persian
assaults upon Palestine, after the last of which in
358 the prophecy must therefore have been written.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>
Others read them as still to come. In our own
country Pusey has been the strongest supporter of
this theory.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> To him the whole book, written before
Amos, is prediction. “It extends from the prophet’s
own day to the end of time.” Joel calls the scourge
the Northern: he directs the priests to pray for its
removal, that <i>the heathen may not rule over God’s
heritage</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> he describes the agent as a responsible
one;<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> his imagery goes far beyond the effects of
locusts, and threatens drought, fire and plague,<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> the
assault of cities and the terrifying of peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> The
scourge is to be destroyed in a way physically inapplicable
to locusts;<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> and the promises of its removal
include the remedy of ravages which mere locusts
could not inflict: the captivity of Judah is to be
turned, and the land recovered from foreigners who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
are to be banished from it.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> Pusey thus reckons as
future the relenting of God, consequent upon the
people’s penitence: chap. ii. 18 ff. The past tenses in
which it is related, he takes as instances of the well-known
prophetic perfect, according to which the
prophets express their assurance of things to come
by describing them as if they had already happened.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly a strong case for the predictive
and allegorical character of the Book of Joel; but a
little consideration will show us that the facts on which
it is grounded are capable of a different explanation
than that which it assumes, and that Pusey has overlooked
a number of other facts which force us to a
literal interpretation of the locusts as a plague already
past, even though we feel they are described in the
language of poetical hyperbole.</p>

<p>For, in the first place, Pusey’s theory implies that
the prophecy is addressed to a future generation, who
shall be alive when the predicted invasions of heathen
come upon the land. Whereas Joel obviously addresses
his own contemporaries. The prophet and
his hearers are one. <i>Before our eyes</i>, he says, <i>the food
has been cut off</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> As obviously, he speaks of the plague
of locusts as of something that has just happened.
His hearers can compare its effects with past disasters,
which it has far exceeded;<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> and it is their duty to hand
down the story of it to future generations.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> Again, his
description is that of a physical, not of a political, plague.
Fields and gardens, vines and figs, are devastated by
being stripped and gnawed. Drought accompanies the
locusts, the seed shrivels beneath the clods, the trees
languish, the cattle pant for want of water.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> These are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
not the trail which an invading army leave behind them.
In support of his theory that human hosts are meant,
Pusey points to the verses which bid the people pray
<i>that the heathen rule not over them</i>, and which describe
the invaders as attacking cities.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> But the former
phrase may be rendered with equal propriety, <i>that the
heathen make not satirical songs about them</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> and as
to the latter, not only do locusts invade towns exactly
as Joel describes, but his words that the invader steals
into houses like <i>a thief</i> are far more applicable to the
insidious entrance of locusts than to the bold and noisy
assault of a storming party. Moreover Pusey and the
other allegorical interpreters of the book overlook the
fact that Joel never so much as hints at the invariable
effects of a human invasion, massacre and plunder.
He describes no slaying and no looting; but when he
comes to the promise that Jehovah will restore the
losses which have been sustained by His people, he
defines them as the years which His army has <i>eaten</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>
But all this proof is clenched by the fact that Joel compares
the locusts to actual soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> They are <i>like</i>
horsemen, the sound of them is <i>like</i> chariots, they run
<i>like</i> horses, and <i>like</i> men of war they leap upon the
wall. Joel could never have compared a real army to
itself!</p>

<p>The allegorical interpretation is therefore untenable.
But some critics, while admitting this, are yet not disposed
to take the first part of the book for narrative. They
admit that the prophet means a plague of locusts, but
they deny that he is speaking of a plague already past,
and hold that his locusts are still to come, that they are
as much a part of the future as the pouring out of the
Spirit<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
and the judgment of the heathen in the Valley
of Jehoshaphat.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> All alike, they are signs or accompaniments
of the Day of Jehovah, and that Day has
still to break. The prophet’s scenery is apocalyptic;
the locusts are “eschatological locusts,” not historical
ones. This interpretation of Joel has been elaborated
by Dr. Adalbert Merx, and the following is a summary
of his opinions.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After examining the book along all the lines of exposition which
have been proposed, Merx finds himself unable to trace any plan or
even sign of a plan; and his only escape from perplexity is the belief
that no plan can ever have been meant by the author. Joel weaves
in one past, present and future, paints situations only to blot them
out and put others in their place, starts many processes but develops
none. His book shows no insight into God’s plan with Israel, but is
purely external; the bearing and the end of it is the material
prosperity of the little land of Judah. From this Merx concludes
that the book is not an original work, but a mere summary of
passages from previous prophets, that with a few reflections of the life
of the Jews after the Return lead us to assign it to that period of
literary culture which Nehemiah inaugurated by the collection of
national writings and which was favoured by the cessation of all political
disturbance. Joel gathered up the pictures of the Messianic age
in the older prophets, and welded them together in one long prayer
by the fervid belief that that age was near. But while the older
prophets spoke upon the ground of actual fact and rose from this to a
majestic picture of the last punishment, the still life of Joel’s time had
nothing such to offer him and he had to seek another basis for his
prophetic flight. It is probable that he sought this in the relation of
Type and Antitype. The Antitype he found in the liberation from
Egypt, the darkness and the locusts of which he transferred to his
canvas from Exodus x. 4–6. The locusts, therefore, are neither
real nor symbolic, but ideal. This is the method of the Midrash and
Haggada in Jewish literature, which constantly placed over against
each other the deliverance from Egypt and the last judgment. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
a method that is already found in such portions of the Old Testament
as Ezekiel xxxvii. and Psalm lxxviii. Joel’s locusts are borrowed from
the Egyptian plagues, but are presented as the signs of the Last Day.
They will bring it near to Israel by famine, drought and the interruption
of worship described in chap. i. Chap. ii., which Merx
keeps distinct from chap. i., is based on a study of Ezekiel, from
whom Joel has borrowed, among other things, the expressions <i>the
garden of Eden</i> and <i>the Northerner</i>. The two verses generally held to
be historic, 18 and 19, Merx takes to be the continuation of the
prayer of the priests, pointing the verbs so as to turn them from
perfects into futures.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>
The rest of the book, Merx strives to show, is
pieced together from many prophets, chiefly Isaiah and Ezekiel, but
without the tender spiritual feeling of the one, or the colossal
magnificence of the other. Special nations are mentioned, but in
this portion of the work we have to do not with events already past,
but with general views, and these not original, but conditioned by the
expressions of earlier writers. There is no history in the book: it is
all ideal, mystical, apocalyptic. That is to say, according to Merx,
there is no real prophet or prophetic fire, only an old man warming
his feeble hands over a few embers that he has scraped together from
the ashes of ancient fires, now nearly wholly dead.</p>

<p>Merx has traced Joel’s relations to other prophets, and reflection
of a late date in Israel’s history, with care and ingenuity; but his
treatment of the text and exegesis of the prophet’s meaning are
alike forced and fanciful. In face of the support which the Massoretic
reading of the hinge of the book, chap. ii. 18 ff., receives from the
ancient versions, and of its inherent probability and harmony with
the context, Merx’s textual emendation is unnecessary, besides being
in itself unnatural.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> While the very same objections which we have
already found valid against the allegorical interpretation equally
dispose of this mystical one. Merx outrages the evident features of
the book almost as much as Hengstenberg and Pusey have done.
He has lifted out of time altogether that which plainly purports to
be historical. His literary criticism is as unsound as his textual. It
is only by ignoring the beautiful poetry of chap. i. that he transplants
it to the future. Joel’s figures are too vivid, too actual, to be
predictive or mystical. And the whole interpretation wrecks itself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
the same verse as the allegorical, the verse, viz., in which Joel plainly
speaks of himself as having suffered with his hearers the plague he
describes.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We may, therefore, with confidence conclude that
the allegorical and mystical interpretations of Joel are
impossible; and that the only reasonable view of our
prophet is that which regards him as calling, in chap.
i. 2—ii. 17, upon his contemporaries to repent in face
of a plague of locusts, so unusually severe that he has
felt it to be ominous of even the Day of the Lord; and
in the rest of his book, as promising material, political
and spiritual triumphs to Israel in consequence of their
repentance, either already consummated, or anticipated
by the prophet as certain.</p>

<p>It is true that the account of the locusts appears to
bear features which conflict with the literal interpretation.
Some of these, however, vanish upon a fuller
knowledge of the awful degree which such a plague
has been testified to reach by competent observers
within our own era.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> Those that remain may be
attributed partly to the poetic hyperbole of Joel’s style,
and partly to the fact that he sees in the plague far
more than itself. The locusts are signs of the Day of
Jehovah. Joel treats them as we found Zephaniah
treating the Scythian hordes of his day. They are as
real as the latter, but on them as on the latter the
lurid glare of Apocalypse has fallen, magnifying them
and investing them with that air of ominousness which
is the sole justification of the allegorical and mystic
interpretation of their appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
To the same sense of their office as heralds of the
last day, we owe the description of the locusts as <i>the
Northerner</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>
The North is not the quarter from which
locusts usually reach Palestine, nor is there any reason
to suppose that by naming the North Joel meant only
to emphasise the unusual character of these swarms.
Rather he takes a name employed in Israel since
Jeremiah’s time to express the instruments of Jehovah’s
wrath in the day of His judgment of Israel. The name
is typical of Doom, and therefore Joel applies it to his
fateful locusts.</p>

  T<span class="small">EXT AND THE</span>
  S<span class="small">TYLE OF THE</span>

<p>Joel’s style is fluent and clear, both when he is
describing the locusts, in which part of his book he
is most original, and when he is predicting, in apocalyptic
language largely borrowed from earlier prophets,
the Day of Jehovah. To the ease of understanding
him we may attribute the sound state of the text
and its freedom from glosses. In this, like most of
the books of the post-exilic prophets, especially the
Books of Haggai, “Malachi” and Jonah, Joel’s book
contrasts very favourably with those of the older
prophets; and that also, to some degree, is proof of
the lateness of his date. The Greek translators have,
on the whole, understood Joel easily and with little error.
In their version there are the usual differences of
grammatical construction, especially in the pronominal
suffixes and verbs, and of punctuation; but very few
bits of expansion and no real additions. These are all
noted in the translation below.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE LOCUSTS AND THE DAY OF THE LORD</p>

<p class="csubtitle">J<span class="small">OEL</span> i.—ii. 17</p>

<p class="noindent">
Joel, as we have seen, found the motive of his
prophecy in a recent plague of locusts, the appearance
of which and the havoc they worked are
described by him in full detail. Writing not only as
a poet but as a seer, who reads in the locusts signs of
the great Day of the Lord, Joel has necessarily put
into his picture several features which carry the
imagination beyond the limits of experience. And yet,
if we ourselves had lived through such a plague, we
should be able to recognise how little license the poet
has taken, and that the seer, so far from unduly mixing
with his facts the colours of Apocalypse, must have
experienced in the terrible plague itself enough to provoke
all the religious and monitory use which he makes
of it.</p>

<p>The present writer has seen but one swarm of locusts,
in which, though it was small and soon swept away by
the wind, he felt not only many of the features that
Joel describes, but even some degree of that singular
helplessness before a calamity of portent far beyond
itself, something of that supernatural edge and accent,
which, by the confession of so many observers, characterise
the locust-plague and the earthquake above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
all other physical disasters. One summer afternoon,
upon the plain of Hauran, a long bank of mist grew
rapidly from the western horizon. The day was dull,
and as the mist rose athwart the sunbeams, struggling
through clouds, it gleamed cold and white, like the
front of a distant snow-storm. When it came near,
it seemed to be more than a mile broad, and was dense
enough to turn the atmosphere raw and dirty, with a
chill as of a summer sea-fog, only that this was not
due to any fall in the temperature. Nor was there
the silence of a mist. We were enveloped by a noise,
less like the whirring of wings than the rattle of hail or
the crackling of bush on fire. Myriads upon myriads
of locusts were about us, covering the ground, and
shutting out the view in all directions. Though they
drifted before the wind, there was no confusion in their
ranks. They sailed in unbroken lines, sometimes
straight, sometimes wavy; and when they passed
pushing through our caravan, they left almost no
stragglers, except from the last battalion, and only the
few dead which we had caught in our hands. After
several minutes they were again but a lustre on the air,
and so melted away into some heavy clouds in the east.</p>

<p>Modern travellers furnish us with terrible impressions
of the innumerable multitudes of a locust-plague, the
succession of their swarms through days and weeks,
and the utter desolation they leave behind them.
Mr. Doughty writes:<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> “There hopped before our feet
a minute brood of second locusts, of a leaden colour,
with budding wings like the spring leaves, and born of
those gay swarms which a few weeks before had passed
over and despoiled the desert. After forty days these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
also would fly as a pestilence, yet more hungry than
the former, and fill the atmosphere.” And later: “The
clouds of the second locust brood which the Arabs call
‘Am’dan, <i>pillars</i>, flew over us for some days, invaded
the booths and for blind hunger even bit our shins.”<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>
It was “a storm of rustling wings.”<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> “This year was
remembered for the locust swarms and great summer
heat.”<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> A traveller in South Africa<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> says: “For the
space of ten miles on each side of the Sea-Cow river
and eighty or ninety miles in length, an area of sixteen
or eighteen hundred square miles, the whole surface
might literally be said to be covered with them.” In
his recently published book on South Africa, Mr. Bryce
writes:—<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a></p>

<p>“It is a strange sight, beautiful if you can forget
the destruction it brings with it. The whole air, to
twelve or even eighteen feet above the ground, is filled
with the insects, reddish brown in body, with bright,
gauzy wings. When the sun’s rays catch them it is
like the sea sparkling with light. When you see them
against a cloud they are like the dense flakes of a
driving snow-storm. You feel as if you had never
before realised immensity in number. Vast crowds of
men gathered at a festival, countless tree-tops rising
along the slope of a forest ridge, the chimneys of
London houses from the top of St. Paul’s—all are as
nothing to the myriads of insects that blot out the sun
above and cover the ground beneath and fill the air
whichever way one looks. The breeze carries them
swiftly past, but they come on in fresh clouds, a host
of which there is no end, each of them a harmless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
creature which you can catch and crush in your hand,
but appalling in their power of collective devastation.”</p>

<p>And take three testimonies from Syria: “The quantity
of these insects is a thing incredible to any one who
has not seen it himself; the ground is covered by them
for several leagues.”<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> “The whole face of the mountain<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>
was black with them. On they came like a living
deluge. We dug trenches and kindled fires, and
beat and burnt to death heaps upon heaps, but
the effort was utterly useless. They rolled up the
mountain-side, and poured over rocks, walls, ditches
and hedges, those behind covering up and passing over
the masses already killed. For some days they continued
to pass. The noise made by them in marching
and foraging was like that of a heavy shower falling
upon a distant forest.”<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> “The roads were covered with
them, all marching and in regular lines, like armies of
soldiers, with their leaders in front; and all the opposition
of man to resist their progress was in vain.”
Having consumed the plantations in the country, they
entered the towns and villages. “When they approached
our garden all the farm servants were employed
to keep them off, but to no avail; though our
men broke their ranks for a moment, no sooner had
they passed the men, than they closed again, and
marched forward through hedges and ditches as before.
Our garden finished, they continued their march toward
the town, devastating one garden after another. They
have also penetrated into most of our rooms: whatever
one is doing one hears their noise from without, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the noise of armed hosts, or the running of many
waters. When in an erect position their appearance
at a little distance is like that of a well-armed
horseman.”<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></p>

<p>Locusts are notoriously adapted for a plague, “since
to strength incredible for so small a creature, they add
saw-like teeth, admirably calculated to eat up all the
herbs in the land.”<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> They are the incarnation of
hunger. No voracity is like theirs, the voracity of
little creatures, whose million separate appetites nothing
is too minute to escape. They devour first grass and
leaves, fruit and foliage, everything that is green and
juicy. Then they attack the young branches of trees,
and then the hard bark of the trunks.<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> “After eating
up the corn, they fell upon the vines, the pulse, the
willows, and even the hemp, notwithstanding its great
bitterness.”<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> “The bark of figs, pomegranates and
oranges, bitter, hard and corrosive, escaped not their
voracity.”<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> “They are particularly injurious to the palm-trees;
these they strip of every leaf and green particle,
the trees remaining like skeletons with bare branches.”<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>
“For eighty or ninety miles they devoured every green
herb and every blade of grass.”<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> “The gardens outside
Jaffa are now completely stripped, even the bark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
of the young trees having been devoured, and look like
a birch-tree forest in winter.”<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> “The bushes were
eaten quite bare, though the animals could not have
been long on the spot. They sat by hundreds on a
bush gnawing the rind and the woody fibres.”<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>
“Bamboo groves have been stripped of their leaves and
left standing like saplings after a rapid bush fire, and
grass has been devoured so that the bare ground appeared
as if burned.”<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> “The country did not seem to be burnt,
but to be much covered with snow through the whiteness
of the trees and the dryness of the herbs.”<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> The
fields finished, they invade towns and houses, in search
of stores. Victual of all kinds, hay, straw, and even
linen and woollen clothes and leather bottles, they
consume or tear in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> They flood through the
open, unglazed windows and lattices: nothing can
keep them out.</p>

<p>These extracts prove to us what little need Joel had
of hyperbole in order to read his locusts as signs of the
Day of Jehovah; especially if we keep in mind that
locusts are worst in very hot summers, and often
accompany an absolute drought along with its consequence
of prairie and forest fires. Some have thought
that, in introducing the effects of fire, Joel only means
to paint the burnt look of a land after locusts have
ravaged it. But locusts do not drink up the streams,
nor cause the seed to shrivel in the earth.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> By these
the prophet must mean drought, and by <i>the flame that
has burned all the trees of the field</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>
the forest fire, finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
an easy prey in the trees which have been reduced to
firewood by the locusts’ teeth.</p>

<p>Even in the great passage in which he passes from
history to Apocalypse, from the gloom and terror of
the locusts to the lurid dawn of Jehovah’s Day, Joel
keeps within the actual facts of experience:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Day of darkness and murk,</div>
<div class="verse">Day of cloud and heavy mist,</div>
<div class="verse">Like dawn scattered on the mountains,</div>
<div class="verse">A people many and powerful.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No one who has seen a cloud of locusts can question
the realism even of this picture: the heavy gloom of
the immeasurable mass of them, shot by gleams of
light where a few of the sun’s imprisoned beams have
broken through or across the storm of lustrous wings.
This is like dawn beaten down upon the hilltops, and
crushed by rolling masses of cloud, in conspiracy to
prolong the night. No: the only point at which Joel
leaves absolute fact for the wilder combinations of
Apocalypse is at the very close of his description,
chap. ii. 10 and 11, and just before his call to repentance.
Here we find, mixed with the locusts, earthquake
and thunderstorm; and Joel has borrowed these
from the classic pictures of the Day of the Lord, using
some of the very phrases of the latter:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Earth trembles before them,</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven quakes,</div>
<div class="verse">Sun and moon become black,</div>
<div class="verse">The stars withdraw their shining,</div>
<div class="verse">And Jehovah utters His voice before His army.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Joel, then, describes, and does not unduly enhance,
the terrors of an actual plague. At first his whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
strength is so bent to make his people feel these,
that, though about to call to repentance, he does not
detail the national sins which require it. In his opening
verses he summons the drunkards,<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> but that
is merely to lend vividness to his picture of facts,
because men of such habits will be the first to feel a
plague of this kind. Nor does Joel yet ask his hearers
what the calamity portends. At first he only demands
that they shall feel it, in its uniqueness and its own
sheer force.</p>

<p>Hence the peculiar style of the passage. Letter for
letter, this is one of the heaviest passages in prophecy.
The proportion in Hebrew of liquids to the other letters
is not large; but here it is smaller than ever. The
explosives and dentals are very numerous. There are
several keywords, with hard consonants and long vowels,
used again and again: Shuddadh, ‘ābhlah, ‘umlal, hôbhîsh.
The longer lines into which Hebrew parallelism
tends to run are replaced by a rapid series of short,
heavy phrases, falling like blows. Critics have called
it rhetoric. But it is rhetoric of a very high order
and perfectly suited to the prophet’s purpose. Look at
chap. i. 10: Shuddadh sadheh, ‘ābhlah ‘adhamah, shuddadh
daghan, hôbhîsh tîrôsh, ‘umlal yiṣḥar.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> Joel loads
his clauses with the most leaden letters he can find, and
drops them in quick succession, repeating the same
heavy word again and again, as if he would stun the
careless people into some sense of the bare, brutal
weight of the calamity which has befallen them.</p>

<p>Now Joel does this because he believes that, if his
people feel the plague in its proper violence, they must
be convinced that it comes from Jehovah. The keynote
of this part of the prophecy is found in chap. i. 15:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
“Keshôdh mishshaddhai,” <i>like violence from the All-violent
doth it come</i>. “If you feel this as it is, you
will feel Jehovah Himself in it. By these very
blows, He and His Day are near. We had been
forgetting how near.” Joel mentions no crime, nor
enforces any virtue: how could he have done so in
so strong a sense that “the Judge was at the door”?
To make men feel that they had forgotten they were
in reach of that Almighty Hand, which could strike so
suddenly and so hard—Joel had time only to make
men feel that, and to call them to repentance. In
this we probably see some reflection of the age: an
age when men’s thoughts were thrusting the Deity
further and further from their life; when they put His
Law and Temple between Him and themselves; and
when their religion, devoid of the sense of His Presence,
had become a set of formal observances, the rending of
garments and not of hearts. But He, whom His own
ordinances had hidden from His people, has burst
forth through nature and in sheer force of calamity.
He has revealed Himself, El-Shaddhai, <i>God All-violent</i>,
as He was known to their fathers, who had no elaborate
law or ritual to put between their fearful hearts and
His terrible strength, but cowered before Him, helpless
on the stripped soil, and naked beneath His thunder.
By just these means did Elijah and Amos bring God
home to the hearts of ancient Israel. In Joel we see
the revival of the old nature-religion, and the revenge
that it was bound to take upon the elaborate systems
which had displaced it, but which by their formalism and
their artificial completeness had made men forget that
near presence and direct action of the Almighty which
it is nature’s own office to enforce upon the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
The thing is true, and permanently valid. Only the
great natural processes can break up the systems of
dogma and ritual in which we make ourselves comfortable
and formal, and drive us out into God’s open
air of reality. In the crash of nature’s forces even
our particular sins are forgotten, and we feel, as in the
immediate presence of God, our whole, deep need of
repentance. So far from blaming the absence of special
ethics in Joel’s sermon, we accept it as natural and
proper to the occasion.</p>

<p>Such, then, appears to be the explanation of the first
part of the prophecy, and its development towards the
call to repentance, which follows it. If we are correct,
the assertion<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> is false that no plan was meant by the
prophet. For not only is there a plan, but the plan
is most suitable to the requirements of Israel, after
their adoption of the whole Law in 445, and forms one
of the most necessary and interesting developments
of all religion: the revival, in an artificial period, of
those primitive forces of religion which nature alone
supplies, and which are needed to correct formalism
and the forgetfulness of the near presence of the
Almighty. We see in this, too, the reason of Joel’s
archaic style, both of conception and expression: that
likeness of his to early prophets which has led so many
to place him between Elijah and Amos.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> They are
wrong. Joel’s simplicity is that not of early prophecy,
but of the austere forces of this revived and applied to
the artificiality of a later age.</p>

<p>One other proof of Joel’s conviction of the religious
meaning of the plague might also have been pled by
the earlier prophets, but certainly not in the terms in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
which Joel expresses it. Amos and Hosea had both
described the destruction of the country’s fertility in
their day as God’s displeasure on His people and (as
Hosea puts it) His divorce of His Bride from Himself.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>
But by them the physical calamities were not threatened
alone: banishment from the land and from enjoyment
of its fruits was to follow upon drought, locusts
and famine. In threatening no captivity Joel differs
entirely from the early prophets. It is a mark of
his late date. And he also describes the divorce
between Jehovah and Israel, through the interruption
of the ritual by the plague, in terms and with an accent
which could hardly have been employed in Israel before
the Exile. After the rebuilding of the Temple and
restoration of the daily sacrifices morning and evening,
the regular performance of the latter was regarded by
the Jews with a most superstitious sense of its indispensableness
to the national life. Before the Exile,
Jeremiah, for instance, attaches no importance to it, in
circumstances in which it would have been not unnatural
for him, priest as he was, to do so.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> But after
the Exile, the greater scrupulousness of the religious
life, and its absorption in ritual, laid extraordinary
emphasis upon the daily offering, which increased to
a most painful degree of anxiety as the centuries went
on.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> The New Testament speaks of <i>the Twelve Tribes
constantly serving God day and night</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> and Josephus,
while declaring that in no siege of Jerusalem before
the last did the interruption ever take place in spite
of the stress of famine and war combined, records the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
awful impression made alike on Jew and heathen by
the giving up of the daily sacrifice on the 17th of July,
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 70, during the investment of the city by Titus.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>
This disaster, which Judaism so painfully feared at every
crisis in its history, actually happened, Joel tells us,
during the famine caused by the locusts. <i>Cut off are
the meal and the drink offerings from the house of
Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> Is not food cut off from our eyes, joy and
gladness from the house of our God?<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> Perhaps He will
turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind Him, meal
and drink offering for Jehovah our God.</i><a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> The break
“of the continual symbol of gracious intercourse between
Jehovah and His people, and the main office of
religion,” means divorce between Jehovah and Israel.
<i>Wail like a bride girt in sackcloth for the husband of her
youth! Wail, O ministers of the altar, O ministers of
God!</i><a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> This then was another reason for reading in
the plague of locusts more than a physical meaning.
This was another proof, only too intelligible to scrupulous
Jews, that the great and terrible Day of the
Lord was at hand.</p>

<p>Thus Joel reaches the climax of his argument.
Jehovah is near, His Day is about to break. From
this it is impossible to escape on the narrow path of
disaster by which the prophet has led up to it. But
beneath that path the prophet passes the ground of a
broad truth, and on that truth, while judgment remains
still as real, there is room for the people to turn from
it. If experience has shown that God is in the present,
near and inevitable, faith remembers that He is there
not willingly for judgment, but with all His ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
feeling for Israel and His zeal to save her. If the
people choose to turn, Jehovah, as their God and as
one who works for their sake, will save them. Of this
God assures them by His own word. For the first time
in the prophecy He speaks for Himself. Hitherto the
prophet has been describing the plague and summoning
to penitence. <i>But now oracle of Jehovah of Hosts.</i><a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>
The great covenant name, <i>Jehovah your God</i>, is solemnly
repeated as if symbolic of the historic origin and age-long
endurance of Jehovah’s relation to Israel; and the
very words of blessing are repeated which were given
when Israel was called at Sinai and the covenant
ratified:—</p>

<p>He has threatened upon you. Once more the nation
is summoned to try Him by prayer: the solemn prayer
of all Israel, pleading that He should not give His people
to reproach.</p>

<p>These are four different names for locusts, which it
is best to translate by their literal meaning. Some think
that they represent one swarm of locusts in four stages
of development, but this cannot be, because the same
swarm never returns upon its path, to complete the work
of destruction which it had begun in an earlier stage of
its growth. Nor can the first-named be the adult brood
from whose eggs the others spring, as Doughty has
described,<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> for that would account only for two of the
four names. Joel rather describes successive swarms
of the insect, without reference to the stages of its
growth, and he does so as a poet, using, in order to
bring out the full force of its devastation, several of the
Hebrew names, that were given to the locust as epithets
of various aspects of its destructive power. The names,
it is true, cannot be said to rise in climax, but at least
the most sinister is reserved to the last.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

takes pause, and in chap. ii. he begins a second with
another call to repentance in face of the same plague.
But the plague has progressed. The locusts are described
now in their invasion not of the country but
of the towns, to which they pass after the country is
stripped. For illustration of the latter see above, p. <a href="#Page_401">401</a>.

<p class="noindent">
<i>Then did Jehovah become jealous for His land, and
took pity upon His people</i>—with these words Joel
opens the second half of his book. Our Authorised
Version renders them in the future tense, as the continuation
of the prophet’s discourse, which had threatened
the Day of the Lord, urged the people to penitence,
and now promises that their penitence shall be followed
by the Lord’s mercy. But such a rendering forces the
grammar;<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> and the Revised English Version is right
in taking the verbs, as the vast majority of critics do,
in the past. Joel’s call to repentance has closed, and
has been successful. The fast has been hallowed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
prayers are heard. Probably an interval has elapsed between
vv. 17 and 18, but in any case, the people having
repented, nothing more is said of their need of doing
so, and instead we have from God Himself a series of
promises, vv. 19–27, in answer to their cry for mercy.
These promises relate to the physical calamity which
has been suffered. God will destroy the locusts, still
impending on the land, and restore the years which
His great army has eaten. There follows in vv. 28–32
(Eng.; Heb. chap, iii.) the promise of a great outpouring
of the Spirit on all Israel, amid terrible
manifestations in heaven and earth.</p>

Dead Sea and Mediterranean are at the extremes of
the compass, but there is no reason to suppose that the
prophet has abandoned the realism which has hitherto
distinguished his treatment of the locusts. The plague
covered the whole land, on whose high watershed the
winds suddenly veer and change. The dispersion of
the locusts upon the deserts and the opposite seas was
therefore possible at one and the same time. Jerome
vouches for an instance in his own day. The other
detail is also true to life. Jerome says that the beaches
of the two seas were strewn with putrifying locusts,
and Augustine<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> quotes heathen writers in evidence of
large masses of locusts, driven from Africa upon the
sea, and then cast up on the shore, which gave rise to a
pestilence. “The south and east winds,” says Volney
of Syria, “drive the clouds of locusts with violence into
the Mediterranean, and drown them in such quantities,
that when their dead are cast on the shore they infect
the air to a great distance.”<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> The prophet continues,
celebrating this destruction of the locusts as if it were
already realised—<i>the Lord hath done greatly</i>, ver.&nbsp;21.
That among the blessings he mentions a full supply
of rain proves that we were right in interpreting him
to have spoken of drought as accompanying the
locusts.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a></p>

<p>Upon these promises of physical blessing there
follows another of the pouring forth of the Spirit: the
prophecy by which Joel became the Prophet of Pentecost,
and through which his book is best known among
Christians.</p>

<p>When fertility has been restored to the land, the
seasons again run their normal courses, and the people
eat their food and be full—<i>It shall come to pass after
these things, I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh</i>.
The order of events makes us pause to question: does
Joel mean to imply that physical prosperity must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
precede spiritual fulness? It would be unfair to assert
that he does, without remembering what he understands
by the physical blessings. To Joel these are
the token that God has returned to His people. The
drought and the famine produced by the locusts
were signs of His anger and of His divorce of the
land. The proofs that He has relented, and taken
Israel back into a spiritual relation to Himself, can,
therefore, from Joel’s point of view, only be given
by the healing of the people’s wounds. In plenteous
rains and full harvests God sets His seal to man’s
penitence. Rain and harvest are not merely physical
benefits, but religious sacraments: signs that God has
returned to His people, and that His zeal is again
stirred on their behalf.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> This has to be made clear
before there can be talk of any higher blessing.
God has to return to His people and to show His
love for them before He pours forth His Spirit upon
them. That is what Joel intends by the order he pursues,
and not that a certain stage of physical comfort
is indispensable to a high degree of spiritual feeling
and experience. The early and latter rains, the fulness
of corn, wine and oil, are as purely religious to Joel,
though not so highly religious, as the phenomena of
the Spirit in men.</p>

<p>But though that be an adequate answer to our
question so far as Joel himself is concerned, it does
not exhaust the question with regard to history in
general. From Joel’s own standpoint physical blessings
may have been as religious as spiritual; but we
must go further, and assert that for Joel’s anticipation
of the baptism of the Spirit by a return of prosperity
there is an ethical reason and one which is permanently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
valid in history. A certain degree of prosperity, and
even of comfort, is an indispensable condition of that
universal and lavish exercise of the religious faculties,
which Joel pictures under the pouring forth of God’s
Spirit.</p>

<p>The history of prophecy itself furnishes us with
proofs of this. When did prophecy most flourish in
Israel? When had the Spirit of God most freedom
in developing the intellectual and moral nature of
Israel? Not when the nation was struggling with
the conquest and settlement of the land, not when
it was engaged with the embarrassments and privations
of the Syrian wars; but an Amos, a Hosea, an
Isaiah came forth at the end of the long, peaceful and
prosperous reigns of Jeroboam II. and Uzziah. The
intellectual strength and liberty of the great Prophet
of the Exile, his deep insight into God’s purposes and
his large view of the future, had not been possible
without the security and comparative prosperity of
the Jews in Babylon, from among whom he wrote. In
Haggai and Zechariah, on the other hand, who worked
in the hunger-bitten colony of returned exiles, there
was no such fulness of the Spirit. Prophecy, we saw,<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>
was then starved by the poverty and meanness of the
national life from which it rose. All this is very
explicable. When men are stunned by such a calamity
as Joel describes, or when they are engrossed by the
daily struggle with bitter enemies and a succession of
bad seasons, they may feel the need of penitence and
be able to speak with decision upon the practical duty
of the moment, to a degree not attainable in better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
days, but they lack the leisure, the freedom and the
resources amid which their various faculties of mind
and soul can alone respond to the Spirit’s influence.</p>
<p>Has it been otherwise in the history of Christianity?
Our Lord Himself found His first disciples, not in a
hungry and ragged community, but amid the prosperity
and opulence of Galilee. They left all to follow Him
and achieved their ministry in poverty and persecution,
but they brought to that ministry the force of minds
and bodies trained in a very fertile land and by a
prosperous commerce.<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> Paul, in his apostolate, sustained
himself by the labour of his hands, but he was
the child of a rich civilisation and the citizen of a
great empire. The Reformation was preceded by the
Renaissance, and on the Continent of Europe drew its
forces, not from the enslaved and impoverished populations
of Italy and Southern Austria, but from the
large civic and commercial centres of Germany. An
acute historian, in his recent lectures on the <i>Economic
Interpretation of History</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> observes that every religious
revival in England has happened upon a basis of comparative
prosperity. He has proved “the opulence
of Norfolk during the epoch of Lollardy,” and pointed
out that “the Puritan movement was essentially and
originally one of the middle classes, of the traders in
towns and of the farmers in the country”; that the
religious state of the Church of England was never so
low as among the servile and beggarly clergy of the
seventeenth and part of the eighteenth centuries; that
the Nonconformist bodies who kept religion alive
during this period were closely identified with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
leading movements of trade and finance;<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> and that even
Wesley’s great revival of religion among the labouring
classes of England took place at a time when prices
were far lower than in the previous century, wages
had slightly risen and “most labourers were small
occupiers; there was therefore in the comparative
plenty of the time an opening for a religious movement
among the poor, and Wesley was equal to the occasion.”
He might have added that the great missionary movement
of the nineteenth century is contemporaneous
with the enormous advance of our commerce and our
empire.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the witness of history is uniform.
Poverty and persecution, <i>famine</i>, <i>nakedness</i>, <i>peril and
sword</i>, put a keenness upon the spirit of religion, while
luxury rots its very fibres; but a stable basis of prosperity
is indispensable to every social and religious
reform, and God’s Spirit finds fullest course in communities
of a certain degree of civilisation and of
freedom from sordidness.</p>

<p>We may draw from this an impressive lesson for
our own day. Joel predicts that, upon the new prosperity
of his land, the lowest classes of society shall
be permeated by the spirit of prophecy. Is it not part
of the secret of the failure of Christianity to enlist
large portions of our population, that the basis of their
life is so sordid and insecure? Have we not yet
to learn from the Hebrew prophets, that some amount
of freedom in a people and some amount of health are
indispensable to a revival of religion? Lives which
are strained and starved, lives which are passed in rank
discomfort and under grinding poverty, without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
possibility of the independence of the individual or of
the sacredness of the home, cannot be religious except
in the most rudimentary sense of the word. For the
revival of energetic religion among such lives we must
wait for a better distribution, not of wealth, but of the
bare means of comfort, leisure and security. When, to
our penitence and our striving, God restores the years
which the locust has eaten, when the social plagues
of rich men’s selfishness and the poverty of the very
poor are lifted from us, then may we look for the
fulfilment of Joel’s prediction—<i>even upon all the slaves
and upon the handmaidens will I pour out My Spirit in
those days</i>.</p>

<p>The economic problem, therefore, has also its place
in the warfare for the kingdom of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
This prophecy divides into two parts—the outpouring
of the Spirit, and the appearance of the terrible Day
of the Lord.</p>

<p>The Spirit of God is to be poured <i>on all flesh</i>, says
the prophet. By this term, which is sometimes applied
to all things that breathe, and sometimes to mankind
as a whole,<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> Joel means Israel only: the heathen are
to be destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> Nor did Peter, when he quoted the
passage at the Day of Pentecost, mean anything more.
He spoke to Jews and proselytes: <i>for the promise is to
you and your children, and to them that are afar off</i>:
it was not till afterwards that he discovered that the
Holy Ghost was granted to the Gentiles, and then
he was unready for the revelation and surprised by
it.<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> But within Joel’s Israel the operation of the Spirit
was to be at once thorough and universal. All classes
would be affected, and affected so that the simplest
and rudest would become prophets.</p>

<p>The limitation was therefore not without its advantages.
In the earlier stages of all religions, it is impossible
to be both extensive and intensive. With a few
exceptions, the Israel of Joel’s time was a narrow and
exclusive body, hating and hated by other peoples.
Behind the Law it kept itself strictly aloof. But without
doing so, Israel could hardly have survived or prepared
itself at that time for its influence on the world.
Heathenism threatened it from all sides with the
most insidious of infections; and there awaited it
in the near future a still more subtle and powerful
means of disintegration. In the wake of Alexander’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
expeditions, Hellenism poured across all the East.
There was not a community nor a religion, save Israel’s,
which was not Hellenised. That Israel remained Israel,
in spite of Greek arms and the Greek mind, was due
to the legalism of Ezra and Nehemiah, and to what
we call the narrow enthusiasm of Joel. The hearts
which kept their passion so confined felt all the deeper
for its limits. They would be satisfied with nothing
less than the inspiration of every Israelite, the fulfilment
of the prayer of Moses: <i>Would to God that all
Jehovah’s people were prophets!</i> And of itself this carries
Joel’s prediction to a wider fulfilment. A nation of
prophets is meant for the world. But even the best of
men do not see the full force of the truth God gives
to them, nor follow it even to its immediate consequences.
Few of the prophets did so, and at first none
of the apostles. Joel does not hesitate to say that
the heathen shall be destroyed. He does not think
of Israel’s mission as foretold by the Second Isaiah;
nor of “Malachi’s” vision of the heathen waiting upon
Jehovah. But in the near future of Israel there was
waiting another prophet to carry Joel’s doctrine to
its full effect upon the world, to rescue the gospel of
God’s grace from the narrowness of legalism and the
awful pressure of Apocalypse, and by the parable of
Jonah, the type of the prophet nation, to show to
Israel that God had granted to the Gentiles also repentance
unto life.</p>

<p>That it was the lurid clouds of Apocalypse, which
thus hemmed in our prophet’s view, is clear from
the next verses. They bring the terrible manifestations
of God’s wrath in nature very closely upon the
lavish outpouring of the Spirit: <i>the sun turned to darkness
and the moon to blood, the great and terrible Day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
of the Lord</i>. Apocalypse must always paralyse the
missionary energies of religion. Who can think of
converting the world, when the world is about to be
convulsed? There is only time for a remnant to be
saved.</p>

<p>But when we get rid of Apocalypse, as the Book
of Jonah does, then we have time and space opened
up again, and the essential forces of such a prophecy
of the Spirit as Joel has given us burst their national
and temporary confines, and are seen to be applicable
to all mankind.</p>

<p class="csubtitle">J<span class="small">OEL</span> iii. (Eng.; iv. Heb.)</p>

<p class="noindent">
Hitherto Joel has spoken no syllable of the
heathen, except to pray that God by His plagues
will not give Israel to be mocked by them. But in
the last chapter of the Book we have Israel’s captivity
to the heathen taken for granted, a promise made that
it will be removed and their land set free from the
foreigner. Certain nations are singled out for judgment,
which is described in the terms of Apocalypse;
and the Book closes with the vision, already familiar in
prophecy, of a supernatural fertility for the land.</p>

<p>It is quite another horizon and far different interests
from those of the preceding chapter. Here for the
first time we may suspect the unity of the Book, and
listen to suggestions of another authorship than Joel’s.
But these can scarcely be regarded as conclusive.
Every prophet, however national his interests, feels
it his duty to express himself upon the subject of
foreign peoples, and Joel may well have done so.
Only, in that case, his last chapter was delivered by
him at another time and in different circumstances from
the rest of his prophecies. Chaps. i.—ii. (Eng.; i.—iii.
Heb.) are complete in themselves. Chap. iii. (Eng.;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
iv. Heb.) opens without any connection of time or

<p>The time of the prophecy is a time when Israel’s
fortunes are at low ebb,<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> her sons scattered among the
heathen, her land, in part at least, held by foreigners.
But it would appear (though this is not expressly said,
and must rather be inferred from the general proofs
of a post-exilic date) that Jerusalem is inhabited.
Nothing is said to imply that the city needs to be
restored.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p>All the heathen nations are to be brought together
for judgment into a certain valley, which the prophet
calls first the Vale of Jehoshaphat and then the Vale
of Decision. The second name leads us to infer that
the first, which means <i>Jehovah-judges</i>, is also symbolic.
That is to say, the prophet does not single out a
definite valley already called Jehoshaphat. In all
probability, however, he has in his mind’s eye some
vale in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, for since
Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> the judgment of the heathen in face of Jerusalem
has been a standing feature in Israel’s vision of
the last things; and as no valley about that city lends
itself to the picture of judgment so well as the valley
of the Kedron with the slopes of Olivet, the name
Jehoshaphat has naturally been applied to it.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> Certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
nations are singled out by name. These are not
Assyria and Babylon, which had long ago perished, nor
the Samaritans, Moab and Ammon, which harassed the
Jews in the early days of the Return from Babylon,
but Tyre, Sidon, Philistia, Edom and Egypt. The
crime of the first three is the robbery of Jewish
treasures, not necessarily those of the Temple, and
the selling into slavery of many Jews. The crime of
Edom and Egypt is that they have shed the innocent
blood of Jews. To what precise events these charges
refer we have no means of knowing in our present
ignorance of Syrian history after Nehemiah. That
the chapter has no explicit reference to the cruelties
of Artaxerxes Ochus in 360 would seem to imply for it
a date earlier than that year. But it is possible that
ver.&nbsp;17 refers to that, the prophet refraining from
accusing the Persians for the very good reason that
Israel was still under their rule.</p>

<p>Another feature worthy of notice is that the
Phœnicians are accused of selling Jews to the sons of
the Jevanîm, Ionians or Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> The latter lie on the
far horizon of the prophet,<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> and we know from classical
writers that from the fifth century onwards numbers of
Syrian slaves were brought to Greece. The other
features of the chapter are borrowed from earlier
prophets.</p>

<p class="noindent">
Apart from the author of the tenth chapter of
Genesis, who defines Javan or Greece as the
father of Elishah and Tarshish, of Kittim or Cyprus
and Rodanim or Rhodes,<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> the first Hebrew writer
who mentions the Greeks is Ezekiel,<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> <i>c.</i> 580 <span class="small">B.C.</span> He
describes them as engaged in commerce with the
Phœnicians, who bought slaves from them. Even
while Ezekiel wrote in Babylonia, the Babylonians
were in touch with the Ionian Greeks through the
Lydians.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> The latter were overthrown by Cyrus about
545, and by the beginning of the next century the
Persian lords of Israel were in close struggle with the
Greeks for the supremacy of the world, and had virtually
been defeated so far as concerned Europe, the
west of Asia Minor, and the sovereignty of the Mediterranean
and Black Seas. In 460 Athens sent an
expedition to Egypt to assist a revolt against Persia,
and even before that Greek fleets had scoured the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
Levant and Greek soldiers, though in the pay of
Persia, had trodden the soil of Syria. Still Joel,
writing towards 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, mentions Greece<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266"
class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> only as
a market to which the Phœnicians carried Jewish
slaves; and in a prophecy which some take to be
contemporary with Joel, Isaiah lxvi., the coasts of
Greece are among the most distant of Gentile lands.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>
In 401 the younger Cyrus brought to the Euphrates
to fight against Artaxerxes Mnemon the ten thousand
Greeks whom, after the battle of Cunaxa, Xenophon
led north to the Black Sea. For nearly seventy years
thereafter Athenian trade slowly spread eastward, but
nothing was yet done by Greece to advertise her to
the peoples of Asia as a claimant for the world’s throne.
Then suddenly in 334 Alexander of Macedon crossed
the Hellespont, spent a year in the conquest of Asia
Minor, defeated Darius at Issus in 332, took Damascus,
Tyre and Gaza, overran the Delta and founded Alexandria.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
In 331 he marched back over Syria, crossed
the Euphrates, overthrew the Persian Empire on the
field of Arbela, and for the next seven years till his
death in 324 extended his conquests to the Oxus and
the Indus. The story, that on his second passage
of Syria Alexander visited Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> is probably
false. But he must have encamped repeatedly within
forty miles of it, and he visited Samaria.<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> It is impossible
that he received no embassy from a people
who had not known political independence for centuries
and must have been only too ready to come to terms
with the new lord of the world. Alexander left behind
him colonies of his veterans, both to the east and
west of the Jordan, and in his wake there poured into
all the cities of the Syrian seaboard a considerable
volume of Greek immigration.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> It is from this time
onward that we find in Greek writers the earliest
mention of the Jews by name. Theophrastus and
Clearchus of Soli, disciples of Aristotle, both speak
of them; but while the former gives evidence of some
knowledge of their habits, the latter reports that in
the perspective of his great master they had been so
distant and vague as to be confounded with the
Brahmins of India, a confusion which long survived
among the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a></p>

<p>Alexander’s death delivered his empire to the
ambitions of his generals, of whom four contested for
the mastery of Asia and Egypt—Antigonus, Ptolemy,
Lysimachus and Seleucus. Of these Ptolemy and
Seleucus emerged victorious, the one in possession of
Egypt, the other of Northern Syria and the rest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
Asia. Palestine lay between them, and both in the
wars which led to the establishment of the two
kingdoms and in those which for centuries followed,
Palestine became the battle-field of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Ptolemy gained Egypt within two years of Alexander’s
death, and from its definite and strongly entrenched
territory he had by 320 conquered Syria and
Cyprus. In 315 or 314 Syria was taken from him by
Antigonus, who also expelled Seleucus from Babylon.
Seleucus fled to Egypt and stirred up Ptolemy to
the reconquest of Syria. In 312 Ptolemy defeated
Demetrius, the general of Antigonus, at Gaza, but the
next year was driven back into Egypt by Antigonus
himself. Meanwhile Seleucus regained Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> In
311 the three made peace with each other, but
Antigonus retained Syria. In 306 they assumed the
title of kings, and in the same year renewed their
quarrel. After a naval battle Antigonus wrested Cyprus
from Ptolemy, but in 301 he was defeated and slain
by Seleucus and Lysimachus at the battle of Ipsus in
Phrygia. His son Demetrius retained Cyprus and
part of the Phœnician coast till 287, when he was
forced to yield them to Seleucus, who had moved the
centre of his power from Babylon to the new Antioch
on the Orontes, with a seaport at Seleucia. Meanwhile
in 301 Ptolemy had regained what the Greeks then
knew as Cœle-Syria, that is all Syria to the south of
Lebanon except the Phœnician coast.<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> Damascus
belonged to Seleucus. But Ptolemy was not allowed
to retain Palestine in peace, for in 297 Demetrius
appears to have invaded it, and Seleucus, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
after his marriage with Stratonike, the daughter of
Demetrius, never wholly resigned his claims to it.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a>
Ptolemy, however, established a hold upon the land,
which continued practically unbroken for a century,
and yet during all that time had to be maintained by
frequent wars, in the course of which the land itself
must have severely suffered (264—248).</p>

<p>Therefore, as in the days of their earliest prophets,
the people of Israel once more lay between two rival
empires. And as Hosea and Isaiah pictured them in
the eighth century, the possible prey either of Egypt
or Assyria, so now in these last years of the fourth
they were tossed between Ptolemy and Antigonus,
and in the opening years of the third were equally
wooed by Ptolemy and Seleucus. Upon this new
alternative of tyranny the Jews appear to have bestowed
the actual names of their old oppressors. Ptolemy was
Egypt to them; Seleucus, with one of his capitals
at Babylon, was still Assyria, from which came in
time the abbreviated Greek form of Syria.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> But,
unlike the ancient empires, these new rival lords
were of one race. Whether the tyranny came from
Asia or Africa, its quality was Greek; and in the
sons of Javan the Jews saw the successors of those
world-powers of Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
which had been concentrated against themselves the
whole force of the heathen world. Our records of
the times are fragmentary, but though Alexander
spared the Jews it appears that they had not long
to wait before feeling the force of Greek arms.
Josephus quotes<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> from Agatharchides of Cnidos
(180—145 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) to the effect that Ptolemy I. surprised
Jerusalem on a Sabbath day and easily took it; and
he adds that at the same time he took a great many
captives from the hill-country of Judæa, from Jerusalem
and from Samaria, and led them into Egypt. Whether
this was in 320 or 312 or 301<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> we cannot tell. It
is possible that the Jews suffered in each of these
Egyptian invasions of Syria, as well as during the
southward marches of Demetrius and Antigonus. The
later policy, both of the Ptolemies, who were their
lords, and of the Seleucids, was for a long time exceedingly
friendly to Israel. Their sufferings from
the Greeks were therefore probably over by 280,
although they cannot have remained unscathed by
the wars between 264 and 248.</p>

<p>The Greek invasion, however, was not like the
Assyrian and Babylonian, of arms alone; but of a
force of intellect and culture far surpassing even the
influences which the Persians had impressed upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
religion and mental attitude of Israel. The ancient
empires had transplanted the nations of Palestine to
Assyria and Babylonia. The Greeks did not need
to remove them to Greece; for they brought Greece
to Palestine. “The Orient,” says Wellhausen, “became
their America.” They poured into Syria, infecting,
exploiting, assimilating its peoples. With dismay the
Jews must have seen themselves surrounded by new
Greek colonies, and still more by the old Palestinian cities
Hellenised in polity and religion. The Greek translator
of Isaiah ix. 12 renders Philistines by Hellenes. Israel
were compassed and penetrated by influences as subtle
as the atmosphere: not as of old uprooted from their
fatherland, but with their fatherland itself infected and
altered beyond all powers of resistance. The full
alarm of this, however, was not felt for many years
to come. It was at first the policy both of the
Seleucids and the Ptolemies to flatter and foster the
Jews. They encouraged them to feel that their religion
had its own place beside the forces of Greece, and was
worth interpreting to the world. Seleucus I. gave to
Jews the rights of citizenship in Asia Minor and
Northern Syria; and Ptolemy I. atoned for his previous
violence by granting them the same in Alexandria.
In the matter of the consequent tribute Seleucus
respected their religious scruples; and it was under
Ptolemy Philadelphus (283—247), if not at his instigation,
that the Law was first translated into Greek.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prophecy, before it finally expired, there was
granted the opportunity to assert itself, upon at least
the threshold of this new era of Israel’s history.</p>

<p>We have from the first half-century of the era
perhaps three or four, but certainly two, prophetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
pieces. By many critics Isaiah xxiv.—xxvii. are
assigned to the years immediately following Alexander’s
campaigns. Others assign Isaiah xix. 16–25 to the last
years of Ptolemy I.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> And of our Book of the Twelve
Prophets, the chapters attached to the genuine prophecies
of Zechariah, or chaps, ix.—xiv. of his book,
most probably fall to be dated from the contests of
Syria and Egypt for the possession of Palestine;
while somewhere about 300 is the most likely date
for the Book of Jonah.</p>

<p>In “Zech.” ix.—xiv. we see prophecy perhaps at
its lowest ebb. The clash with the new foes produces
a really terrible thirst for the blood of the heathen:
there are schisms and intrigues within Israel which
in our ignorance of her history during this time it is
not possible for us to follow: the brighter gleams,
which contrast so forcibly with the rest, may be more
ancient oracles that the writer has incorporated with
his own stern and dark Apocalypse.</p>

<p>In the Book of Jonah, on the other hand, we find
a spirit and a style in which prophecy may not
unjustly be said to have given its highest utterance.
And this alone suffices, in our uncertainty as to the
exact date of the book, to take it last of all our
Twelve. For “in this book,” as Cornill has finely
said, “the prophecy of Israel quits the scene of battle
as victor, and as victor in its severest struggle—that
against self.”</p>

<p class="captitle">CHAPTERS IX.—XIV. OF “ZECHARIAH”</p>

<p class="noindent">
We saw that the first eight chapters of the Book
of Zechariah were, with the exception of a
few verses, from the prophet himself. No one has
ever doubted this. No one could doubt it: they are
obviously from the years of the building of the Temple,
520—516 <span class="small">B.C.</span> They hang together with a consistency
exhibited by few other groups of chapters in the Old
Testament.</p>

<p>But when we pass into chap. ix. we find ourselves
in circumstances and an atmosphere altogether different.
Israel is upon a new situation of history, and the words
addressed to her breathe another spirit. There is not
the faintest allusion to the building of the Temple—the
subject from which all the first eight chapters
depend. There is not a single certain reflection of
the Persian period, under the shadow of which the
first eight chapters were all evidently written. We
have names of heathen powers mentioned, which not
only do not occur in the first eight chapters, but of
which it is not possible to think that they had any
interest whatever for Israel between 520 and 516:
Damascus, Hadrach, Hamath, Assyria, Egypt and
Greece. The peace, and the love of peace, in which
Zechariah wrote, has disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> Nearly everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
breathes of war actual or imminent. The heathen are
spoken of with a ferocity which finds few parallels
in the Old Testament. There is a revelling in their
blood, of which the student of the authentic prophecies
of Zechariah will at once perceive that gentle lover of
peace could not have been capable. And one passage
figures the imminence of a thorough judgment upon
Jerusalem, very different from Zechariah’s outlook
upon his people’s future from the eve of the completion
of the Temple. It is not surprising, therefore, that
one of the earliest efforts of Old Testament criticism
should have been to prove another author than Zechariah
for chaps. ix.—xiv. of the book called by his name.</p>

<p>The very first attempt of this kind was made so
far back as 1632 by the Cambridge theologian Joseph
Mede,<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> who was moved thereto by the desire to
vindicate the correctness of St. Matthew’s ascription<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a>
of “Zech.” xi. 13 to the prophet Jeremiah. Mede’s
effort was developed by other English exegetes.
Hammond assigned chaps. x.—xii., Bishop Kidder<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>
and William Whiston, the translator of Josephus, chaps.
ix.—xiv., to Jeremiah. Archbishop Newcome<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> divided
them, and sought to prove that while chaps. ix.—xi.
must have been written before 721, or a century earlier
than Jeremiah, because of the heathen powers they
name, and the divisions between Judah and Israel,
chaps. xii.—xiv. reflect the imminence of the Fall of
Jerusalem. In 1784 Flügge<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> offered independent proof
that chaps. ix.—xiv. were by Jeremiah; and in 1814
Bertholdt<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
suggested that chaps. ix.—xi. might be by
Zechariah the contemporary of Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> and on that
account attached to the prophecies of his younger
namesake. These opinions gave the trend to the
main volume of criticism, which, till fifteen years ago,
deemed “Zech.” ix.—xiv. to be pre-exilic. So Hitzig,
who at first took the whole to be from one hand, but
afterwards placed xii.—xiv. by a different author under
Manasseh. So Ewald, Bleek, Kuenen (at first), Samuel
Davidson, Schrader, Duhm (in 1875), and more recently
König and Orelli, who assign chaps. ix.—xi. to the
reign of Ahaz, but xii.—xiv. to the eve of the Fall of
Jerusalem, or even a little later.</p>

<p>Some critics, however, remained unmoved by the
evidence offered for a pre-exilic date. They pointed
out in particular that the geographical references were
equally suitable to the centuries after the Exile.
Damascus, Hadrach and Hamath,<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> though politically
obsolete by 720, entered history again with the campaigns
of Alexander the Great in 332—331, and the
establishment of the Seleucid kingdom in Northern
Syria.<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> Egypt and Assyria<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> were names used after
the Exile for the kingdom of the Ptolemies, and for
those powers which still threatened Israel from the
north, or Assyrian quarter. Judah and Joseph or
Ephraim<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> were names still used after the Exile to
express the whole of God’s Israel; and in chaps.
ix.—xiv. they are presented, not divided as before 721,
but united. None of the chapters give a hint of any
king in Jerusalem; and all of them, while representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>the great Exile of Judah as already begun, show a
certain dependence in style and even in language upon
Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Isaiah xl.—lxvi. Moreover the
language is post-exilic, sprinkled with Aramaisms and
with other words and phrases used only, or mainly,
by Hebrew writers from Jeremiah onwards.</p>

<p>But though many critics judged these grounds to be
sufficient to prove the post-exilic origin of “Zech.”
ix.—xiv., they differed as to the author and exact date
of these chapters. Conservatives like Hengstenberg,<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>
Delitzsch, Keil, Köhler and Pusey used the evidence
to prove the authorship of Zechariah himself after 516,
and interpreted the references to the Greek period as
pure prediction. Pusey says<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> that chaps. ix.—xi.
extend from the completion of the Temple and its
deliverance during the invasion of Alexander, and
from the victories of the Maccabees, to the rejection of
the true shepherd and the curse upon the false; and
chaps. xi.—xii. “from a future repentance for the death
of Christ to the final conversion of the Jews and
Gentiles.”<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a></p>

<p>But on the same grounds Eichhorn<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> saw in the
chapters not a prediction but a reflection of the Greek
period. He assigned chaps. ix. and x. to an author in
the time of Alexander the Great; xi.—xiii. 6 he placed
a little later, and brought down xiii. 7—xiv. to the
Maccabean period. Böttcher<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> placed the whole in
the wars of Ptolemy and Seleucus after Alexander’s
death; and Vatke, who had at first selected a date in
the reign of Artaxerxes Longhand, 464—425, finally
decided for the Maccabean period, 170 ff.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
In recent times the most thorough examination of
the chapters has been that by Stade,<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> and the conclusion
he comes to is that chaps. ix.—xiv. are all from
one author, who must have written during the early
wars between the Ptolemies and Seleucids about 280
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, but employed, especially in chaps. ix., x., an
earlier prophecy. A criticism and modification of
Stade’s theory is given by Kuenen. He allows that
the present form of chaps. ix.—xiv. must be of post-exilic
origin: this is obvious from the mention of the
Greeks as a world-power; the description of a siege
of Jerusalem by <i>all</i> the heathen; the way in which
(chaps. ix. 11 f., but especially x. 6–9) the captivity is
presupposed, if not of all Israel, yet of Ephraim; the
fact that the House of David are not represented
as governing; and the thoroughly priestly character
of all the chapters. But Kuenen holds that an ancient
prophecy of the eighth century underlies chaps. ix.—xi.,
xiii. 7–9, in which several actual phrases of it survive;<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>
and that in their present form xii.—xiv. are older
than ix.—xi., and probably by a contemporary of Joel,
about 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In the main Cheyne,<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> Cornill,<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> Wildeboer<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> and
Staerk<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> adhere to Stade’s conclusions. Cheyne proves
the unity of the six chapters and their date <i>before</i> the
Maccabean period. Staerk brings down xi. 4–17 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
xiii. 7–9 to 171 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Wellhausen argues for the unity,
and assigns it to the Maccabean times. Driver judges
ix.—xi., with its natural continuation xiii. 7–9, as not
earlier than 333; and the rest of xii.—xiv. as certainly
post-exilic, and probably from 432—300. Rubinkam<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>
places ix. 1–10 in Alexander’s time, the rest in that of
the Maccabees, but Zeydner<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> all of it to the latter.
Kirkpatrick,<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> after showing the post-exilic character of
all the chapters, favours assigning ix.—xi. to a different
author from xii.—xiv. Asserting that to the question of
the exact date it is impossible to give a definite answer,
he thinks that the whole may be with considerable
probability assigned to the first sixty or seventy years
of the Exile, and is therefore in its proper place
between Zechariah and “Malachi.” The reference to
the sons of Javan he takes to be a gloss, probably
added in Maccabean times.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen from this catalogue of conclusions
that the prevailing trend of recent criticism has been to
assign “Zech.” ix.—xiv. to post-exilic times, and to a
different author from chaps. i.—viii.; and that while
a few critics maintain a date soon after the Return, the
bulk are divided between the years following Alexander’s
campaigns and the time of the Maccabean struggles.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>

<p>There are, in fact, in recent years only two attempts
to support the conservative position of Pusey and
Hengstenberg that the whole book is a genuine work
of Zechariah the son of Iddo. One of these is by
C. H. H. Wright in his Bampton Lectures. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
other is by George L. Robinson, now Professor
at Toronto, in a reprint (1896) from the <i>American
Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures</i>, which
offers a valuable history of the discussion of the whole
question from the days of Mede, with a careful argument
of all the evidence on both sides. The very original
conclusion is reached that the chapters reflect the
history of the years 518—516 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In discussing the question, for which our treatment
of other prophets has left us too little space, we need
not open that part of it which lies between a pre-exilic
and a post-exilic date. Recent criticism of all
schools and at both extremes has tended to establish
the latter upon reasons which we have already
stated,<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> and for further details of which the student
may be referred to Stade’s and Eckardt’s investigations
in the <i>Zeitschrift für A. T. Wissenschaft</i> and to
Kirkpatrick’s impartial summary. There remain the
questions of the unity of chaps. ix.—xiv.; their exact
date or dates after the Exile, and as a consequence
of this their relation to the authentic prophecies of
Zechariah in chaps. i.—viii.</p>

<p>On the question of unity we take first chaps. ix.—xi.,
to which must be added (as by most critics since
Ewald) xiii. 7–9, which has got out of its place as the
natural continuation and conclusion of chap. xi.</p>

<p>Chap. ix. 1–8 predicts the overthrow of heathen
neighbours of Israel, their possession by Jehovah
and His safeguard of Jerusalem. Vv. 9–12 follow
with a prediction of the Messianic King as the Prince
of Peace; but then come vv. 13–17, with no mention of
the King, but Jehovah appears alone as the hero of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
His people against the Greeks, and there is indeed
sufficiency of war and blood. Chap. x. makes a new
start: the people are warned to seek their blessings
from Jehovah, and not from Teraphim and diviners,
whom their false shepherds follow. Jehovah, visiting
His flock, shall punish these, give proper rulers, make
the people strong and gather in their exiles to fill
Gilead and Lebanon. Chap. xi. opens with a burst
of war on Lebanon and Bashan and the overthrow
of the heathen (vv. 1–3), and follows with an allegory,
in which the prophet first takes charge from Jehovah
of the people as their shepherd, but is contemptuously
treated by them (4–14), and then taking the guise
of an evil shepherd represents what they must suffer
from their next ruler (15–17). This tyrant, however,
shall receive punishment, two-thirds of the nation shall
be scattered, but the rest, further purified, shall be
God’s own people (xiii. 7–9).</p>

<p>In the course of this prophesying there is no conclusive
proof of a double authorship. The only passage
which offers strong evidence for this is chap. ix.
The verses predicting the peaceful coming of Messiah
(9–12) do not accord in spirit with those which follow
predicting the appearance of Jehovah with war and
great shedding of blood. Nor is the difference
altogether explained, as Stade thinks, by the similar
order of events in chap. x., where Judah and Joseph
are first represented as saved and brought back in
ver.&nbsp;6, and then we have the process of their redemption
and return described in vv. 7 ff. Why did the
same writer give statements of such very different
temper as chap. ix. 9–12 and 13–17? Or, if these
be from different hands, why were they ever put
together? Otherwise there is no reason for breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
up chaps. ix.—xi., xiii. 7–9. Rubinkam, who separates
ix. 1–10 by a hundred and fifty years from the rest;
Bleek, who divides ix. from x.; and Staerk, who
separates ix.—xi. 3 from the rest, have been answered
by Robinson and others.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> On the ground of language,
grammar and syntax, Eckardt has fully proved that
ix.—xi. are from the same author of a late date, who,
however, may have occasionally followed earlier models
and even introduced their very phrases.<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a></p>

<p>More supporters have been found for a division of
authorship between chaps. ix.—xi., xiii. 7–9, and chaps.
xii.—xiv. (less xiii. 7–9). Chap. xii. opens with a title
of its own. A strange element is introduced into the
historical relation. Jerusalem is assaulted not by the
heathen only, but by Judah, who, however, turns on
finding that Jehovah fights for Jerusalem, and is saved
by Jehovah before Jerusalem in order that the latter
may not boast over it (xii. 1–9). A spirit of grace and
supplication is poured upon the guilty city, a fountain
opened for uncleanness, idols abolished, and the
prophets, who are put on a level with them, abolished
too, where they do not disown their profession (xii. 10—xiii.
6). Another assault of the heathen on Jerusalem
is described, half of the people being taken captive.
Jehovah appears, and by a great earthquake saves the
rest. The land is transformed. And then the prophet
goes back to the defeat of the heathen assault on the
city, in which Judah is again described as taking part;
and the surviving heathen are converted, or, if they
refuse to be, punished by the withholding of rain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
Jerusalem is holy to the Lord (xiv.). In all this there is
more that differs from chaps. ix.—xi., xiii. 7–9, than the
strange opposition of Judah and Jerusalem. Ephraim,
or Joseph, is not mentioned, nor any return of exiles,
nor punishment of the shepherds, nor coming of the
Messiah,<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> the latter’s place being taken by Jehovah.
But in answer to this we may remember that the
Messiah, after being described in ix. 9–12, is immediately
lost behind the warlike coming of Jehovah. Both
sections speak of idolatry, and of the heathen, their
punishment and conversion, and do so in the same
apocalyptic style. Nor does the language of the two
differ in any decisive fashion. On the contrary, as
Eckardt<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> and Kuiper have shown, the language is
on the whole an argument for unity of authorship.<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>
There is, then, nothing conclusive against the position,
which Stade so clearly laid down and strongly fortified,
that chaps. ix.—xiv. are from the same hand, although,
as he admits, this cannot be proved with absolute
certainty. So also Cheyne: “With perhaps one or two
exceptions, chaps. ix.—xi. and xii.—xiv. are so closely
welded together that even analysis is impossible.”<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a></p>

<p>The next questions we have to decide are whether
chaps. ix.—xiv. offer any evidence of being by Zechariah,
the author of chaps. i.—viii., and if not to what other
post-exilic date they may be assigned.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that in language and in style
the two parts of the Book of Zechariah have features
in common. But that these have been exaggerated by
defenders of the unity there can be no doubt. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
cannot infer anything from the fact<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> that both parts
contain specimens of clumsy diction, of the repetition
of the same word, of phrases (not the same phrases)
unused by other writers;<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> or that each is lavish in
vocatives; or that each is variable in his spelling.
Resemblances of that kind they share with other books:
some of them are due to the fact that both sections are
post-exilic. On the other hand, as Eckardt has clearly
shown, there exists a still greater number of differences
between the two sections, both in language and
in style.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> Not only do characteristic words occur in
each which are not found in the other, not only do
chaps. ix.—xiv. contain many more Aramaisms than
chaps. i.—viii., and therefore symptoms of a later date;
but both parts use the same words with more or less
different meanings, and apply different terms to the
same objects. There are also differences of grammar,
of favourite formulas, and of other features of the
phraseology, which, if there be any need, complete
the proof of a distinction of dialect so great as to
require to account for it distinction of authorship.</p>

<p>The same impression is sustained by the contrast of
the historical circumstances reflected in each of the two
sections. Zech. i.—viii. were written during the building
of the Temple. There is no echo of the latter in
“Zech.” ix.—xiv. Zech. i.—viii. picture the whole earth
as at peace, which was true at least of all Syria: they
portend no danger to Jerusalem from the heathen, but
describe her peace and fruitful expansion in terms
most suitable to the circumstances imposed upon her
by the solid and clement policy of the earlier Persian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
kings. This is all changed in “Zech.” ix.—xiv. The
nations are restless; a siege of Jerusalem is imminent,
and her salvation is to be assured only by much war
and a terrible shedding of blood. We know exactly
how Israel fared and felt in the early sections of the
Persian period: her interests in the politics of the
world, her feelings towards her governors and her
whole attitude to the heathen were not at that time
those which are reflected in “Zech.” ix.—xiv.</p>

<p>Nor is there any such resemblance between the
religious principles of the two sections of the Book of
Zechariah as could prove identity of origin. That
both are spiritual, or that they have a similar expectation
of the ultimate position of Israel in the
history of the world, proves only that both were late
offshoots from the same religious development, and
worked upon the same ancient models. Within these
outlines, there are not a few divergences. Zech. i.—viii.
were written before Ezra and Nehemiah had imposed
the Levitical legislation upon Israel; but Eckardt has
shown the dependence on the latter of “Zech.” ix.—xiv.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, adhere to Canon Driver’s assertion,
that Zechariah in chaps. i.—viii. “uses a different
phraseology, evinces different interests and moves in
a different circle of ideas from those which prevail in
chaps. ix.—xiv.”<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> Criticism has indeed been justified
in separating, by the vast and growing majority of its
opinions, the two sections from each other. This was
one of the earliest results which modern criticism
achieved, and the latest researches have but established
it on a firmer basis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
If, then, chaps. ix.—xiv. be not Zechariah’s, to what
date may we assign them? We have already seen that
they bear evidence of being upon the whole later than
Zechariah, though they appear to contain fragments
from an earlier period. Perhaps this is all we can
with certainty affirm. Yet something more definite is
at least probable. The mention of the Greeks, not
as Joel mentions them about 400, the most distant
nation to which Jewish slaves could be carried, but as
the chief of the heathen powers, and a foe with whom
the Jews are in touch and must soon cross swords,<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>
appears to imply that the Syrian campaign of Alexander
is happening or has happened, or even that the Greek
kingdoms of Syria and Egypt are already contending
for the possession of Palestine. With this agrees the
mention of Damascus, Hadrach and Hamath, the
localities where the Seleucids had their chief seats.<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> In
that case Asshur would signify the Seleucids and Egypt
the Ptolemies:<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> it is these, and not Greece itself, from
whom the Jewish exiles have still to be redeemed. All
this makes probable the date which Stade has proposed
for the chapters, between 300 and 280 <span class="small">B.C.</span> To bring
them further down, to the time of the Maccabees, as
some have tried to do, would not be impossible so far
as the historical allusions are concerned; but had they
been of so late a date as that, viz. 170 or 160, we may
assert that they could not have found a place in the
prophetic canon, which was closed by 200, but must
have fallen along with Daniel into the Hagiographa.</p>

<p>The appearance of these prophecies at the close of
the Book of Zechariah has been explained, not quite
satisfactorily, as follows. With the Book of “Malachi”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
they formed originally three anonymous pieces,<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> which
because of their anonymity were set at the end of the
Book of the Twelve. The first of them begins with
the very peculiar construction “Massa’ Dĕbar Jehovah,”
<i>oracle of the word of Jehovah</i>, which, though partly belonging
to the text, the editor read as a title, and attached
as a title to each of the others. It occurs nowhere else.
The Book of “Malachi” was too distinct in character
to be attached to another book, and soon came to
have the supposed name of its author added to its
title.<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> But the other two pieces fell, like all anonymous
works, to the nearest writing with an author’s name.
Perhaps the attachment was hastened by the desire to
make the round number of Twelve Prophets.</p>

<p class="noindent">
From the number of conflicting opinions which
prevail upon the subject, we have seen how
impossible it is to decide upon a scheme of division
for “Zech.” ix.—xiv. These chapters consist of a
number of separate oracles, which their language and
general conceptions lead us on the whole to believe
were put together by one hand, and which, with the
possible exception of some older fragments, reflect the
troubled times in Palestine that followed on the invasion
of Alexander the Great. But though the most of them
are probably due to one date and possibly come from
the same author, these oracles do not always exhibit
a connection, and indeed sometimes show no relevance
to each other. It will therefore be simplest to take
them piece by piece, and, before giving the translation
of each, to explain the difficulties in it and indicate the
ruling ideas.</p>

<h4 id="XXXIIIsec1">1. T<span class="small">HE</span>
  C<span class="small">OMING OF THE</span>
   G<span class="small">REEKS</span> (ix. 1–8).</h4>

<p>This passage runs exactly in the style of the early
prophets. It figures the progress of war from the
north of Syria southwards by the valley of the Orontes
to Damascus, and then along the coasts of Phœnicia
and the Philistines. All these shall be devastated,
but Jehovah will camp about His own House and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
it shall be inviolate. This is exactly how Amos or
Isaiah might have pictured an Assyrian campaign, or
Zephaniah a Scythian. It is not surprising, therefore,
that even some of those who take the bulk of
“Zech.” ix.—xiv. as post-exilic should regard ix. 1–5
as earlier even than Amos, with post-exilic additions
only in vv. 6–8.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> This is possible. Vv. 6–8 are
certainly post-exilic, because of their mention of the
half-breeds, and their intimation that Jehovah will
take unclean food out of the mouth of the heathen;
but the allusions in vv. 1–5 suit an early date. They
equally suit, however, a date in the Greek period. The
progress of war from the Orontes valley by Damascus
and thence down the coast of Palestine follows the line
of Alexander’s campaign in 332, which must also have
been the line of Demetrius in 315 and of Antigonus in
311. The evidence of language is mostly in favour
of a late date.<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> If Ptolemy I. took Jerusalem in 320,<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>
then the promise, no assailant shall return (ver.&nbsp;8), is
probably later than that.</p>

<p>In face then of Alexander’s invasion of Palestine,
or of another campaign on the same line, this oracle
repeats the ancient confidence of Isaiah. God rules:
His providence is awake alike for the heathen and
for Israel. <i>Jehovah hath an eye for mankind, and all
the tribes of Israel.</i><a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> The heathen shall be destroyed,
but Jerusalem rest secure; and the remnant of the
heathen be converted, according to the Levitical notion,
by having unclean foods taken out of their mouths.</p>

<p>This beautiful picture, applied by the Evangelist with
such fitness to our Lord upon His entry to Jerusalem,
must also be of post-exilic date. It contrasts with the
warlike portraits of the Messiah drawn in pre-exilic
times, for it clothes Him with humility and with peace.
The coming King of Israel has the attributes already
imputed to the Servant of Jehovah by the prophet of
the Babylonian captivity. The next verses also imply
the Exile as already a fact. On the whole, too, the
language is of a late rather than of an early date.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>
Nothing in the passage betrays the exact point of
its origin after the Exile.</p>

<p>The epithets applied to the Messiah are of very great
interest. He does not bring victory or salvation, but
is the passive recipient of it.<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> This determines the
meaning of the preceding adjective, <i>righteous</i>, which
has not the moral sense of <i>justice</i>, but rather that of
<i>vindication</i>, in which <i>righteousness</i> and <i>righteous</i> are so
frequently used in Isa. xl.—lv.<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> He is <i>lowly</i>, like the
Servant of Jehovah; and comes riding not the horse,
an animal for war, because the next verse says that
horses and chariots are to be removed from Israel,<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
but the ass, the animal not of lowliness, as some
have interpreted, but of peace. To this day in the
East asses are used, as they are represented in the
Song of Deborah, by great officials, but only when
these are upon civil, and not upon military, duty.</p>

<p>It is possible that this oracle closes with ver.&nbsp;10,
and that we should take vv. 11 and 12, on the
deliverance from exile, with the next.</p>

<p><i>Rejoice mightily, daughter of Zion! shout aloud,
daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, thy King cometh to thee,

chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and

the nations, and His rule shall be from sea to sea and

too,—by thy covenant-blood,<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> I have set free thy prisoners

<p>The next oracle seems singularly out of keeping
with the spirit of the last, which declared the arrival
of the Messianic peace, while this represents Jehovah
as using Israel for His weapons in the slaughter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
the Greeks and heathens, in whose blood they shall
revel. But Stade has pointed out how often in chaps.
ix.—xiv. a result is first stated and then the oracle
goes on to describe the process by which it is achieved.
Accordingly we have no ground for affirming ix. 13–17
to be by another hand than ix. 9–12. The apocalyptic
character of the means by which the heathen are to
be overthrown, and the exultation displayed in their
slaughter, as in a great sacrifice (ver.&nbsp;15), betray
Israel in a state of absolute political weakness, and
therefore suit a date after Alexander’s campaigns,
which is also made sure by the reference to the <i>sons
of Javan</i>, as if Israel were now in immediate contact
with them. Kirkpatrick’s note should be read, in
which he seeks to prove <i>the sons of Javan</i> a late
gloss;<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> but his reasons do not appear conclusive.
The language bears several traces of lateness.<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a></p>

<p>This little piece is connected with the previous one
only through the latter’s conclusion upon the fertility
of the land, while this opens with rain, the requisite of
fertility. It is connected with the piece that follows only
by its mention of the shepherdless state of the people,
the piece that follows being against the false shepherds.
These connections are extremely slight. Perhaps the
piece is an independent one. The subject of it gives
no clue to the date. Sorcerers are condemned both
by the earlier prophets, and by the later.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> Stade

<p>The unity of this section is more apparent than its
connection with the preceding, which had spoken of
the want of a shepherd, or religious director, of Israel,
while this is directed against their shepherds and
leaders, meaning their foreign tyrants.<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> The figure is
taken from Jeremiah xxiii. 1 ff., where, besides, <i>to visit

<i>visit</i><a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> in the sense of to look after, just as within
ver.&nbsp;3 of this tenth chapter. Who these foreign
tyrants are is not explicitly stated, but the reference
to Egypt and Assyria as lands whence the Jewish
captives shall be brought home, while at the same time
there is a Jewish nation in Judah, suits only the Greek
period, after Ptolemy had taken so many Jews to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> and there were numbers still scattered throughout
the other great empire in the north, to which,
as we have already seen, the Jews applied the name
of Assyria. The reference can hardly suit the years
after Seleucus and Ptolemy granted to the Jews in
their territories the rights of citizens. The captive
Jews are to be brought back to Gilead and Lebanon.
Why exactly these are mentioned, and neither Samaria

assign the chapter. The language of x. 3–12 has

<p>The passage predicts that Jehovah will change His
poor leaderless sheep, the Jews, into war-horses, and
give them strong chiefs and weapons of war. They
shall overthrow the heathen, and Jehovah will bring
back His exiles. The passage is therefore one with
chap. ix.</p>

<p>This is taken by some with the previous chapter, by
others with the passage following. Either connection
seems precarious. No conclusion as to date can be
drawn from the language. But the localities threatened
were on the southward front of the Seleucid kingdom.
<i>Open, Lebānon, thy doors</i> suits the Egyptian invasions
of that kingdom. To which of these the passage

<p>There follows now, in the rest of chap. xi., a longer
oracle, to which Ewald and most critics after him have
suitably attached chap. xiii. 7–9.</p>

<p>This passage appears to rise from circumstances
similar to those of the preceding and from the same
circle of ideas. Jehovah’s people are His flock and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
have suffered. Their rulers are their shepherds; and
the rulers of other peoples are their shepherds. A
true shepherd is sought for Israel in place of the evil
ones which have distressed them. The language shows
traces of a late date.<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> No historical allusion is obvious
in the passage. The <i>buyers</i> and <i>sellers</i> of God’s sheep
might reflect the Seleucids and Ptolemies between whom
Israel were exchanged for many years, but probably
mean their native leaders. The <i>three shepherds cut off
in a month</i> were interpreted by the supporters of the
pre-exilic date of the chapters as Zechariah and Shallum
(2 Kings xv. 8–13), and another whom these critics
assume to have followed them to death, but of him the
history has no trace. The supporters of a Maccabean
date for the prophecy recall the quick succession of
high priests before the Maccabean rising. The <i>one
month</i> probably means nothing more than a very short
time.</p>

<p>The allegory which our passage unfolds is given,
like so many more in Hebrew prophecy, to the prophet
himself to enact. It recalls the pictures in Jeremiah
and Ezekiel of the overthrow of the false shepherds
of Israel, and the appointment of a true shepherd.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>
Jehovah commissions the prophet to become shepherd
to His sheep that have been so cruelly abused by their
guides and rulers. Like the shepherds of Palestine,
the prophet took two staves to herd his flock. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
called one <i>Grace</i>, the other <i>Union</i>. In a month he
cut off three shepherds—both <i>month</i> and <i>three</i> are
probably formal terms. But he did not get on well
with his charge. They were wilful and quarrelsome.
So he broke his staff Grace, in token that his
engagement was dissolved. The dealers of the sheep
saw that he acted for God. He asked for his wage,
if they cared to give it. They gave him thirty pieces
of silver, the price of an injured slave,<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> which by
God’s command he cast into the treasury of the Temple,
as if in token that it was God Himself whom they
paid with so wretched a sum. And then he broke
his other staff, to signify that the brotherhood between
Judah and Israel was broken. Then, to show the
people that by their rejection of the good shepherd
they must fall a prey to an evil one, the prophet
assumed the character of the latter. But another judgment
follows. In chap. xiii. 7–9 the good shepherd is
smitten and the flock dispersed.</p>

<p>The spiritual principles which underlie this allegory
are obvious. God’s own sheep, persecuted and helpless
though they be, are yet obstinate, and their obstinacy
not only renders God’s good-will to them futile, but
causes the death of the one man who could have done
them good. The guilty sacrifice the innocent, but in
this execute their own doom. That is a summary of
the history of Israel. But had the writer of this allegory
any special part of that history in view? Who were
the <i>dealers of the flock</i>?</p>

<p><i>Thus saith Jehovah my God:<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> Shepherd the flock of

shepherded the sheep. And I destroyed the three shepherds
in one month. Then was my soul vexed with them,
and they on their part were displeased with me. And
I said: I will not shepherd you: what is dead, let it die;
and what is destroyed, let it be destroyed; and those that
survive, let them devour one another’s flesh! And I took
my staff Grace, and I brake it so as to annul my covenant
which I made with all the peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> And in that

watched me, knew that it was Jehovah’s word. And I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
said to them, If it be good in your sight, give me my
wage, and if it be not good, let it go! And they weighed
out my wage, thirty pieces of silver. Then said Jehovah
to me, Throw it into the treasury<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> (the precious wage

thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the House of Jehovah,

<h4 id="XXXIIIsec8">8. J<span class="small">UDAH</span> <i>versus</i>

<p>A title, though probably of later date than the text,<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>
introduces with the beginning of chap. xii. an oracle
plainly from circumstances different from those of the
preceding chapters. The nations, not particularised as
they have been, gather to the siege of Jerusalem, and,
very singularly, Judah is gathered with them against
her own capital. But God makes the city like one of
those great boulders, deeply embedded, which husbandmen
try to pull up from their fields, but it tears and
wounds the hands of those who would remove it.
Moreover God strikes with panic all the besiegers, save
only Judah, who, her eyes being opened, perceives
that God is with Jerusalem and turns to her help.
Jerusalem remains in her place; but the glory of the
victory is first Judah’s, so that the house of David may
not have too much fame nor boast over the country
districts. The writer doubtless alludes to some temporary
schism between the capital and country caused
by the arrogance of the former. But we have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
means of knowing when this took place. It must often
have been imminent in the days both before and
especially after the Exile, when Jerusalem had absorbed
all the religious privilege and influence of the nation.
The language is undoubtedly late.<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a></p>

<p>The figure of Jerusalem as a boulder, deeply bedded
in the soil, which tears the hands that seek to remove
it, is a most true and expressive summary of the history
of heathen assaults upon her. Till she herself was
rent by internal dissensions, and the Romans at last
succeeded in tearing her loose, she remained planted
on her own site.<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> This was very true of all the Greek
period. Seleucids and Ptolemies alike wounded themselves
upon her. But at what period did either of
them induce Judah to take part against her? Not in
the Maccabean.</p>

<h5><i>Oracle of the Word of Jehovah upon Israel.</i></h5>

<p><i>Oracle of Jehovah, who stretched out the heavens and
founded the earth, and formed the spirit of man within
him: Lo, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling
for all the surrounding peoples, and even Judah<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> shall

lifted<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> by all the peoples—all who lift it do indeed wound<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>
themselves—and there are gathered against it all nations
of the earth. In that day—oracle of Jehovah—I will
smite every horse with panic, and their riders with madness;
but as for the house of Judah, I will open its<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a>

of Hosts their God. In that day will I make the districts
of Judah like a pan of fire among timber and like a torch
among sheaves, so that they devour right and left all the
peoples round about, but Jerusalem shall still abide on its

  (xii. 8—xiii. 6)</h4>

<p>Upon the deliverance of Jerusalem, by the help of
the converted Judah, there follow four results, each
introduced by the words that it happened <i>in that day</i>
(xii. 8, 9, xiii. 1, 2). First, the people of Jerusalem
shall themselves be strengthened. Second, the hostile
heathen shall be destroyed, but on the house of David
and all Jerusalem the spirit of penitence shall be poured,
and they will lament for the good shepherd whom
they slew. Third, a fountain for sin and uncleanness
shall be opened. Fourth, the idols, the unclean spirit,
and prophecy, now so degraded, shall all be abolished.
The connection of these oracles with the preceding
is obvious, as well as with the oracle describing the
murder of the good shepherd (xiii. 7–9). When we
see how this is presupposed by xii. 9 ff., we feel more
than ever that its right place is between chaps. xi. and
xii. There are no historical allusions. But again the
language gives evidence of a late date.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> And throughout
the passage there is a repetition of formal phrases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
which recalls the Priestly Code and the general style of
the post-exilic age.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> Notice that no king is mentioned,
although there are several points at which, had he
existed, he must have been introduced.</p>

<p>1. The first of the four effects of Jerusalem’s deliverance
from the heathen is the promotion of her weaklings
to the strength of her heroes, and of her heroes to
divine rank (xii. 8). <i>In that day Jehovah will protect
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the lame among
them shall in that day be like David</i> himself <i>, and the
house of David like God, like the Angel of Jehovah
before them</i>.</p>

<p>2. The second paragraph of this series very remarkably
emphasises that upon her deliverance Jerusalem
shall not give way to rejoicing, but to penitent lamentation
for the murder of him whom she has pierced—the
good shepherd whom her people have rejected and
slain. This is one of the few ethical strains which run
through these apocalyptic chapters. It forms their
highest interest for us. Jerusalem’s mourning is compared
to that for <i>Hadad-Rimmon in the valley</i> or <i>plain
of Megiddo</i>. This is the classic battle-field of the land,
and the theatre upon which Apocalypse has placed the
last contest between the hosts of God and the hosts
of evil.<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> In Israel’s history it had been the ground
not only of triumph but of tears. The greatest tragedy
of that history, the defeat and death of the righteous
Josiah, took place there;<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> and since the earliest Jewish
interpreters the <i>mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the
valley of Megiddo</i> has been referred to the mourning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
for Josiah.<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> Jerome identifies Hadad-Rimmon with
Rummâni,<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> a village on the plain still extant, close to
Megiddo. But the lamentation for Josiah was at
Jerusalem; and it cannot be proved that Hadad-Rimmon
is a place-name. It may rather be the name of the
object of the mourning, and as Hadad was a divine
name among Phœnicians and Arameans, and Rimmôn
the pomegranate was a sacred tree, a number of critics
have supposed this to be a title of Adonis, and the
mourning like that excessive grief which Ezekiel tells
us was yearly celebrated for Tammuz.<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> This, however,
is not fully proved.<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> Observe, further, that while
the reading Hadad-Rimmon is by no means past doubt,
the sanguine blossoms and fruit of the pomegranate,
“red-ripe at the heart,” would naturally lead to its
association with the slaughtered Adonis.</p>

<p><i>And it shall come to pass in that day that I will
seek to destroy all the nations who have come in upon
Jerusalem. And I will pour upon the house of David
and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
grace and of supplication, and they shall look to him<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>
whom they have pierced; and they shall lament for him,
as with lamentation for an only son, and bitterly grieve
for him, as with grief for a first-born. In that day
lamentation shall be as great in Jerusalem as the lamentation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
for Hadad-Rimmon<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> in the valley of Megiddo.
And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the
family of the house of David by itself, and their wives
by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by
itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the
house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves;
the family of Shime’i<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> by itself, and their wives by themselves;
all the families who are left, every family by
itself, and their wives by themselves.</i></p>

<p>3. The third result of Jerusalem’s deliverance from
the heathen shall be the opening of a fountain of
cleansing. This purging of her sin follows fitly upon
her penitence just described. <i>In that day a fountain
shall be opened for the house of David, and for the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.</i><a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a></p>

<p>4. The fourth consequence is the removal of idolatry,
of the unclean spirit and of the degraded prophets from
her midst. The last is especially remarkable: for
it is not merely false prophets, as distinguished from
true, who shall be removed; but prophecy in general.
It is singular that in almost its latest passage the prophecy
of Israel should return to the line of its earliest
representative, Amos, who refused to call himself
prophet. As in his day, the prophets had become
mere professional and mercenary oracle-mongers,
abjured to the point of death by their own ashamed
and wearied relatives.</p>

<p><i>And it shall be in that day—oracle of Jehovah of
Hosts—I will cut off the names of the idols from the
land, and they shall not be remembered any more. And
also the prophets and the unclean spirit will I expel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
from the land. And it shall come to pass, if any man
prophesy again, then shall his father and mother who
begat him say to him, Thou shall not live, for thou
speakest falsehood in the name of Jehovah; and his
father and mother who begat him shall stab him for his
prophesying. And it shall be in that day that the
prophets shall be ashamed of their visions when they
prophesy, and shall not wear the leather cloak in order
to lie. And he will say, No prophet am I! A tiller
of the ground I am, for the ground is my possession<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a>
from my youth up. And they shall say to him, What
are these wounds in<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> thy hands? and he shall say,
What I was wounded with in the house of my lovers!</i></p>

<p>In another apocalyptic vision the prophet beholds
Jerusalem again beset by the heathen. But Jehovah
Himself intervenes, appearing in person, and an
earthquake breaks out at His feet. The heathen are
smitten, as they stand, into mouldering corpses. The
remnant of them shall be converted to Jehovah and
take part in the annual Feast of Booths. If any refuse
they shall be punished with drought. But Jerusalem
shall abide in security and holiness: every detail of her
equipment shall be consecrate. The passage has many
resemblances to the preceding oracles.<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> The language
is undoubtedly late, and the figures are borrowed from
other prophets, chiefly Ezekiel. It is a characteristic
specimen of the Jewish Apocalypse. The destruction
of the heathen is described in verses of terrible grimness:
there is no tenderness nor hope exhibited for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
them. And even in the picture of Jerusalem’s holiness
we have no really ethical elements, but the details
are purely ceremonial.</p>

<p><i>Lo! a day is coming for Jehovah,<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> when thy spoil will
be divided in thy midst. And I will gather all the nations
to besiege Jerusalem, and the city will be taken and the
houses plundered and the women ravished, and the half
of the city shall go into captivity, but the rest of the people
shall not be cut off from the city. And Jehovah shall
go forth and do battle with those nations, as in the day
when He fought in the day of contest. And His feet shall
stand in that day on the Mount of Olives which is over
against Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives
shall be split into halves from east to west by a very great
ravine, and half of the Mount will slide northwards and
half southwards. ...,<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> for the ravine of mountains<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> shall

security. And this shall be the stroke with which Jehovah
will smite all the peoples who have warred against

These two verses, 13 and 14, obviously disturb the
connection, which ver.&nbsp;15 as obviously resumes with
ver.&nbsp;12. They are, therefore, generally regarded as an
intrusion.<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> But why they have been inserted is not
clear. ver.&nbsp;14 is a curious echo of the strife between
Judah and Jerusalem described in chap. xii. They
may be not a mere intrusion, but simply out of their
proper place: yet, if so, where this proper place lies in
these oracles is impossible to determine.]</p>

<p><i>And even so shall be the plague upon the horses, mules,
camels and asses, and all the beasts which are in those
camps—just like this plague. And it shall come to pass
that all that survive of all the nations who have come up
against Jerusalem, shall come up from year to year to do
obeisance to King Jehovah of Hosts, and to keep the Feast
of Booths. And it shall come to pass that whosoever of
all the races of the earth will not come up to Jerusalem
to do obeisance to King Jehovah of Hosts, upon them
there shall be no rain. And if the race of Egypt go not
up nor come in, upon them also shall<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> come the plague,
with which Jehovah shall strike the nations that go not
up to keep the Feast of Booths. Such shall be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
punishment<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> of Egypt, and the punishment<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452a" id="FNanchor_1452_1452a"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a>
of all nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.</i></p>

<p>The Feast of Booths was specially one of thanksgiving
for the harvest; that is why the neglect of it is
punished by the withholding of the rain which brings
the harvest. But such a punishment for such a neglect
shows how completely prophecy has become subject
to the Law. One is tempted to think what Amos
or Jeremiah or even “Malachi” would have thought of
this. Verily all the writers of the prophetical books
do not stand upon the same level of religion. The
writer remembers that the curse of no rain cannot
affect the Egyptians, the fertility of whose rainless land
is secured by the annual floods of her river. So he
has to insert a special verse for Egypt. She also will
be plagued by Jehovah, yet he does not tell us in what
fashion her plague will come.</p>

<p>The book closes with a little oracle of the most
ceremonial description, connected not only in temper
but even by subject with what has gone before. The
very horses, which hitherto have been regarded as
too foreign,<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> or—as even in this group of oracles<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>—as
too warlike, to exist in Jerusalem, shall be consecrated
to Jehovah. And so vast shall be the multitudes
who throng from all the earth to the annual feasts and
sacrifices at the Temple, that the pots of the latter
shall be as large as the great altar-bowls,<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> and
every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be consecrated
for use in the ritual. This hallowing of the horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
raises the question, whether the passage can be from
the same hand as wrote the prediction of the disappearance
of all horses from Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a></p>

<p><i>In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses,
Holiness unto Jehovah. And the</i> very <i>pots in the House
of Jehovah shall be as the bowls before the altar. Yea,
every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to
Jehovah of Hosts, and all who sacrifice shall come and
take of them and cook in them. And there shall be no
more any pedlar<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> in the House of Jehovah of Hosts in

<p class="captitle">THE BOOK OF JONAH</p>

<p class="noindent">
The book of Jonah is cast throughout in the form
of narrative—the only one of our Twelve which is
so. This fact, combined with the extraordinary events
which the narrative relates, starts questions not raised by
any of the rest. Besides treating, therefore, of the book’s
origin, unity, division and other commonplaces of introduction,
we must further seek in this chapter reasons
for the appearance of such a narrative among a collection
of prophetic discourses. We have to ask whether the
narrative be intended as one of fact; and if not, why
the author was directed to the choice of such a form to
enforce the truth committed to him.</p>

<p>The appearance of a narrative among the Twelve
Prophets is not, in itself, so exceptional as it seems to
be. Parts of the Books of Amos and Hosea treat of the
personal experience of their authors. The same is true
of the Books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in which
the prophet’s call and his attitude to it are regarded as
elements of his message to men. No: the peculiarity
of the Book of Jonah is not the presence of narrative,
but the apparent absence of all prophetic discourse.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a></p>

<p>Yet even this might be explained by reference to the
first part of the prophetic canon—Joshua to Second
Kings.<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
These Former Prophets, as they are called, are
wholly narrative—narrative in the prophetic spirit and
written to enforce a moral. Many of them begin as the
Book of Jonah does:<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> they contain stories, for instance,
of Elijah and Elisha, who flourished immediately before
Jonah and like him were sent with commissions to
foreign lands. It might therefore be argued that the
Book of Jonah, though narrative, is as much a prophetic
book as they are, and that the only reason why it has
found a place, not with these histories, but among the
Later Prophets, is the exceedingly late date of its
composition.<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a></p>

<p>This is a plausible, but not the real, answer to our
question. Suppose we were to find the latter by
discovering that the Book of Jonah, though in narrative
form, is not real history at all, nor pretends to be;
but, from beginning to end, is as much a prophetic
sermon as any of the other Twelve Books, yet cast
in the form of parable or allegory? This would
certainly explain the adoption of the book among the
Twelve; nor would its allegorical character appear
without precedent to those (and they are among the
most conservative of critics) who maintain (as the
present writer does not) the allegorical character of
the story of Hosea’s wife.<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, when we pass from the form to the
substance of the book that we perceive the full justification
of its reception among the prophets. The truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
which we find in the Book of Jonah is as full and
fresh a revelation of God’s will as prophecy anywhere
achieves. That God has <i>granted to the Gentiles also
repentance unto life</i><a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> is nowhere else in the Old Testament
so vividly illustrated. It lifts the teaching of the
Book of Jonah to equal rank with the second part of
Isaiah, and nearest of all our Twelve to the New Testament.
The very form in which this truth is insinuated
into the prophet’s reluctant mind, by contrasting God’s
pity for the dim population of Niniveh with Jonah’s own
pity for his perished gourd, suggests the methods of our
Lord’s teaching, and invests the book with the morning
air of that high day which shines upon the most
evangelic of His parables.</p>

<p>One other remark is necessary. In our effort to
appreciate this lofty gospel we labour under a disadvantage.
That is our sense of humour—our modern
sense of humour. Some of the figures in which
our author conveys his truth cannot but appear to
us grotesque. How many have missed the sublime
spirit of the book in amusement or offence at its
curious details! Even in circles in which the acceptance
of its literal interpretation has been demanded
as a condition of belief in its inspiration, the story has
too often served as a subject for humorous remarks.
This is almost inevitable if we take it as history. But
we shall find that one advantage of the theory, which
treats the book as parable, is that the features, which
appear so grotesque to many, are traced to the
popular poetry of the writer’s own time and shown
to be natural. When we prove this, we shall be able
to treat the scenery of the book as we do that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
some early Christian fresco, in which, however rude
it be or untrue to nature, we discover an earnestness
and a success in expressing the moral essence of a
situation that are not always present in works of art
more skilful or more correct.</p>

<p>Jonah ben-Amittai, from Gath-hepher<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> in Galilee,
came forward in the beginning of the reign of
Jeroboam II. to announce that the king would regain
the lost territories of Israel from the Pass of Hamath
to the Dead Sea.<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> He flourished, therefore, about
780, and had this book been by himself we should
have had to place it first of all the Twelve, and nearly
a generation before that of Amos. But the book
neither claims to be by Jonah, nor gives any proof of
coming from an eye-witness of the adventures which
it describes,<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> nor even from a contemporary of the
prophet. On the contrary, one verse implies that when
it was written Niniveh had ceased to be a great city.<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a>
Now Niniveh fell, and was practically destroyed, in
606 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> In all ancient history there was no collapse
of an imperial city more sudden or so complete.<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> We
must therefore date the Book of Jonah some time after
606, when Niniveh’s greatness had become what it
was to the Greek writers, a matter of tradition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
A late date is also proved by the language of
the book. This not only contains Aramaic elements
which have been cited to support the argument for a
northern origin in the time of Jonah himself,<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> but a
number of words and grammatical constructions which
we find in the Old Testament, some of them in the
later and some only in the very latest writings.<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a>
Scarcely less decisive are a number of apparent quotations
and echoes of passages in the Old Testament,
mostly later than the date of the historical Jonah, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
some of them even later than the Exile.<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> If it could
be proved that the Book of Jonah quotes from Joel,
that would indeed set it down to a very late date—probably
about 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the period of the composition
of Ezra-Nehemiah, with the language of which its
own shows most affinity.<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> This would leave time for
its reception into the Canon of the Prophets, which
was closed by 200 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> Had the book been later it
would undoubtedly have fallen, like Daniel, within the
Hagiographa.</p>

<p>Nor does this book, written so many centuries after
Jonah had passed away, claim to be real history. On
the contrary, it offers to us all the marks of the parable
or allegory. We have, first of all, the residence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
Jonah for the conventional period of three days and
three nights in the belly of the great fish, a story not
only very extraordinary in itself and sufficient to provoke
the suspicion of allegory (we need not stop to
argue this), but apparently woven, as we shall see,<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>
from the materials of a myth well known to the Hebrews.
We have also the very general account of Niniveh’s
conversion, in which there is not even the attempt to
describe any precise event. The absence of precise
data is indeed conspicuous throughout the book. “The
author neglects a multitude of things, which he would
have been obliged to mention had history been his
principal aim. He says nothing of the sins of which
Niniveh was guilty,<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> nor of the journey of the prophet
to Niniveh, nor does he mention the place where he
was cast out upon the land, nor the name of the
Assyrian king. In any case, if the narrative were
intended to be historical, it would be incomplete by
the frequent fact, that circumstances which are necessary
for the connection of events are mentioned later
than they happened, and only where attention has to
be directed to them as having already happened.”<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>
We find, too, a number of trifling discrepancies, from
which some critics<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> have attempted to prove the presence
of more than one story in the composition of the
book, but which are simply due to the license a writer
allows himself when he is telling a tale and not writing
a history. Above all, there is the abrupt close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
story at the very moment at which its moral is obvious.<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>
All these things are symptoms of the parable—so
obvious and so natural, that we really sin against the
intention of the author, and the purpose of the Spirit
which inspired him, when we wilfully interpret the
book as real history.<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a></p>

<h4 id="XXXIVsec3">3. T<span class="small">HE</span>
  P<span class="small">URPOSE OF THE</span>
  B<span class="small">OOK</span>.</h4>

<p>The general purpose of this parable is very clear.
It is not, as some have maintained,<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> to explain why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
the judgments of God and the predictions of His
prophets were not always fulfilled—though this also
becomes clear by the way. The purpose of the parable,
and it is patent from first to last, is to illustrate the
mission of prophecy to the Gentiles, God’s care for them,
and their susceptibility to His word. More correctly,
it is to enforce all this truth upon a prejudiced and
thrice-reluctant mind.<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>Whose was this reluctant mind? In Israel after the
Exile there were many different feelings with regard
to the future and the great obstacle which heathendom
interposed between Israel and the future. There was
the feeling of outraged justice, with the intense conviction
that Jehovah’s kingdom could not be established
save by the overthrow of the cruel kingdoms of this
world. We have seen that conviction expressed in
the Book of Obadiah. But the nation, which read and
cherished the visions of the Great Seer of the Exile,<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a>
could not help producing among her sons men with
hopes about the heathen of a very different kind—men
who felt that Israel’s mission to the world was not one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
of war, but of service in those high truths of God and
of His Grace which had been committed to herself.
Between the two parties it is certain there was much
polemic, and we find this still bitter in the time of our
Lord. And some critics think that while Esther,
Obadiah and other writings of the centuries after the
Return represent the one side of this polemic, which
demanded the overthrow of the heathen, the Book of
Jonah represents the other side, and in the vexed and
reluctant prophet pictures such Jews as were willing
to proclaim the destruction of the enemies of Israel,
and yet like Jonah were not without the lurking fear
that God would disappoint their predictions and in His
patience leave the heathen room for repentance.<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> Their
dogmatism could not resist the impression of how long
God had actually spared the oppressors of His people,
and the author of the Book of Jonah cunningly sought
these joints in their armour to insinuate the points of
his doctrine of God’s real will for nations beyond the
covenant. This is ingenious and plausible. But in
spite of the cleverness with which it has been argued
that the details of the story of Jonah are adapted to
the temper of the Jewish party who desired only
vengeance on the heathen, it is not at all necessary
to suppose that the book was the produce of mere
polemic. The book is too simple and too grand for
that. And therefore those appear more right who conceive
that the writer had in view, not a Jewish party,
but Israel as a whole in their national reluctance to
fulfil their Divine mission to the world.<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> Of them God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
had already said: <i>Who is blind but My servant, or deaf
as My messenger whom I have sent?... Who gave
Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers? Did not
Jehovah, He against whom we have sinned?—for they
would not walk in His ways, neither were they obedient to
His law.</i><a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> Of such a people Jonah is the type. Like
them he flees from the duty God has laid upon him.
Like them he is, beyond his own land, cast for a set
period into a living death, and like them rescued again
only to exhibit once more upon his return an ill-will
to believe that God had any fate for the heathen
except destruction. According to this theory, then,
Jonah’s disappearance in the sea and the great fish,
and his subsequent ejection upon dry land, symbolise
the Exile of Israel and their restoration to Palestine.</p>

<p>In proof of this view it has been pointed out that, while
the prophets frequently represent the heathen tyrants
of Israel as the sea or the sea-monster, one of them has
actually described the nation’s exile as its swallowing
by a monster, whom God forces at last to disgorge his
living prey<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a>. The full illustration of this will be given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
in Chapter XXXVI. on “The Great Fish and What it
Means.” Here it is only necessary to mention that the
metaphor was borrowed, not, as has been alleged by
many, from some Greek, or other foreign, myth, which,
like that of Perseus and Andromeda, had its scene
in the neighbourhood of Joppa, but from a Semitic
mythology which was well known to the Hebrews, and
the materials of which were employed very frequently
by other prophets and poets of the Old Testament.<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a></p>

<p>Why, of all prophets, Jonah should have been selected
as the type of Israel, is a question hard but perhaps
not impossible to answer. In history Jonah appears
only as concerned with Israel’s reconquest of her lands
from the heathen. Did the author of the book say:
I will take such a man, one to whom tradition attributes
no outlook beyond Israel’s own territories, for
none could be so typical of Israel, narrow, selfish and
with no love for the world beyond herself? Or did
the author know some story about a journey of Jonah
to Niniveh, or at least some discourse by Jonah against
the great city? Elijah went to Sarepta, Elisha took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
God’s word to Damascus: may there not have been,
though we are ignorant of it, some connection between
Niniveh and the labours of Elisha’s successor? Thirty
years after Jonah appeared, Amos proclaimed the
judgment of Jehovah upon foreign nations, with the
destruction of their capitals; about the year 755 he
clearly enforced, as equal with Israel’s own, the moral
responsibility of the heathen to the God of righteousness.
May not Jonah, almost the contemporary of
Amos, have denounced Niniveh in the same way?
Would not some tradition of this serve as the nucleus
of history, round which our author built his allegory?
It is possible that Jonah proclaimed doom upon
Niniveh; yet those who are familiar with the prophesying
of Amos, Hosea, and, in his younger days, Isaiah,
will deem it hardly probable. For why do all these
prophets exhibit such reserve in even naming Assyria,
if Israel had already through Jonah entered into such
articulate relations with Niniveh? We must, therefore,
admit our ignorance of the reasons which led our author
to choose Jonah as a type of Israel. We can only
conjecture that it may have been because Jonah was
a prophet, whom history identified only with Israel’s
narrower interests. If, during subsequent centuries,
a tradition had risen of Jonah’s journey to Niniveh or
of his discourse against her, such a tradition has
probability against it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more definite origin for the book than any yet
given has been suggested by Professor Budde.<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> The
Second Book of Chronicles refers to a <i>Midrash of the
Book of the Kings</i><a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> for further particulars concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
King Joash. A <i>Midrash</i><a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> was the expansion, for
doctrinal or homiletic purposes, of a passage of
Scripture, and very frequently took the form, so dear
to Orientals, of parable or invented story about the
subject of the text. We have examples of Midrashim
among the Apocrypha, in the Books of Tobit and
Susannah and in the Prayer of Manasseh, the same as
is probably referred to by the Chronicler.<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> That the
Chronicler himself used the <i>Midrash of the Book of the
Kings</i> as material for his own book is obvious from the
form of the latter and its adaptation of the historical
narratives of the Book of Kings.<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> The Book of Daniel
may also be reckoned among the Midrashim, and
Budde now proposes to add to their number the Book
of Jonah. It may be doubted whether this distinguished
critic is right in supposing that the book formed the
Midrash to 2 Kings xiv. 25 ff. (the author being
desirous to add to the expression there of Jehovah’s
pity upon Israel some expression of His pity upon the
heathen), or that it was extracted just as it stands, in
proof of which Budde points to its abrupt beginning
and end. We have seen another reason for the
latter;<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> and it is very improbable that the Midrashim,
so largely the basis of the Books of Chronicles, shared
that spirit of universalism which inspires the Book of
Jonah.<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> But we may well believe that it was in some
Midrash of the Book of Kings that the author of the
Book of Jonah found the basis of the latter part of
his immortal work, which too clearly reflects the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
fortunes and conduct of all Israel to have been wholly
drawn from a Midrash upon the story of the individual
prophet Jonah.</p>

  L<span class="small">ORD’S</span>
  U<span class="small">SE OF THE</span>
  B<span class="small">OOK</span>.</h4>

<p>We have seen, then, that the Book of Jonah is not
actual history, but the enforcement of a profound
religious truth nearer to the level of the New Testament
than anything else in the Old, and cast in the
form of Christ’s own parables. The full proof of this
can be made clear only by the detailed exposition of
the book. There is, however, one other question,
which is relevant to the argument. Christ Himself
has employed the story of Jonah. Does His use of it
involve His authority for the opinion that it is a story
of real facts?</p>

<p>Two passages of the Gospels contain the words of
our Lord upon Jonah: Matt. xii. 39, 41, and Luke xi.
29, 30.<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> <i>A generation, wicked and adulterous, seeketh a
sign, and sign shall not be given it, save the sign of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
prophet Jonah. &hellip; The men of Niniveh shall stand up
in the Judgment with this generation, and condemn it, for
they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a
greater than Jonah is here. This generation is an evil
generation: it seeketh a sign; and sign shall not be given
it, except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign
to the Ninivites, so also shall the Son of Man be to this
generation.</i></p>

<p>These words, of course, are compatible with the
opinion that the Book of Jonah is a record of real fact.
The only question is, are they also compatible with the
opinion that the Book of Jonah is a parable? Many
say No; and they allege that those of us who hold
this opinion are denying, or at least ignoring, the
testimony of our Lord; or that we are taking away
the whole force of the parallel which He drew. This
is a question of interpretation, not of faith. We do
not believe that our Lord had any thought of confirming
or not confirming the historic character of the
story. His purpose was purely one of exhortation,
and we feel the grounds of that exhortation to be just
as strong, when we have proven the Book of Jonah
to be a parable. Christ is using an illustration: it
surely matters not whether that illustration be drawn
from the realms of fact or of poetry. Again and again
in their discourses to the people do men use illustrations
and enforcements drawn from traditions of the
past. Do we, even when the historical value of these
traditions is <i>very</i> ambiguous, give a single thought to
the question of their historical character? We never
think of it. It is enough for us that the tradition is
popularly accepted and familiar. And we cannot deny
to our Lord that which we claim for ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
conservative writers admit this. In his recent Introduction
to Jonah Orelli says expressly: “It is not,
indeed, proved with conclusive necessity that, if the
resurrection of Jesus was a physical fact, Jonah’s abode
in the fish’s belly must also be just as historical.”<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a></p>

<p>Upon the general question of our Lord’s authority
in matters of criticism, His own words with regard to
personal questions may be appositely quoted: <i>Man,
who made Me a judge or divider over you? I am come
not to judge ... but to save.</i> Such matters our Lord
surely leaves to ourselves, and we have to decide them
by our reason, our common-sense and our loyalty to
truth—of all of which He Himself is the creator, and
of which we shall have to render to Him an account
at the last. Let us remember this, and we shall use
them with equal liberty and reverence. <i>Bringing every
thought into subjection to Christ</i> is surely just using our
knowledge, our reason, and every other intellectual
gift which He has given us, with the accuracy and
the courage of His own Spirit.</p>

<p>The next question is that of the Unity of the Book.
Several attempts have been made to prove from discrepancies,
some real and some alleged, that the book
is a compilation of stories from several different hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
But these essays are too artificial to have obtained any
adherence from critics; and the few real discrepancies
of narrative from which they start are due, as we have
seen, rather to the license of a writer of parable than
to any difference of authorship.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a></p>

<p>In the question of the Unity of the Book, the Prayer
or Psalm in chap. ii. offers a problem of its own, consisting
as it does almost entirely of passages parallel
to others in the Psalter. Besides a number of religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
phrases, which are too general for us to say that one
prayer has borrowed them from another,<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> there are
several unmistakeable repetitions of the Psalms.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p>And yet the Psalm of Jonah has strong features,
which, so far as we know, are original to it. The horror
of the great deep has nowhere in the Old Testament
been described with such power or with such conciseness.
So far, then, the Psalm is not a mere string
of quotations, but a living unity. Did the author of
the book himself insert it where it stands? Against
this it has been urged that the Psalm is not the prayer
of a man inside a fish, but of one who on dry land
celebrates a deliverance from drowning, and that if the
author of the narrative himself had inserted it, he
would rather have done so after ver.&nbsp;11, which records
the prophet’s escape from the fish.<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> And a usual theory
of the origin of the Psalm is that a later editor, having
found the Psalm ready-made and in a collection where
it was perhaps attributed to Jonah,<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a> inserted it after
ver.&nbsp;2, which records that Jonah did pray from the
belly of the fish, and inserted it there the more readily,
because it seemed right for a book which had found
its place among the Twelve Prophets to contribute,
as all the others did, some actual discourse of the
prophet whose name it bore.<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> This, however, is not
probable. Whether the original author found the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>Psalm ready to his hand or made it, there is a great
deal to be said for the opinion of the earlier critics,<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> that
he himself inserted it, and just where it now stands.
For, from the standpoint of the writer, Jonah was
already saved, when he was taken up by the fish—saved
from the deep into which he had been cast by
the sailors, and the dangers of which the Psalm so
vividly describes. However impossible it be for us to
conceive of the compilation of a Psalm (even though
full of quotations) by a man in Jonah’s position,<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> it
was consistent with the standpoint of a writer who had
just affirmed that the fish was expressly <i>appointed by
Jehovah</i>, in order to save his penitent servant from the
sea. To argue that the Psalm is an intrusion is therefore
not only unnecessary, but it betrays failure to
appreciate the standpoint of the writer. Given the fish
and the Divine purpose of the fish, the Psalm is
intelligible and appears at its proper place. It were
more reasonable indeed to argue that the fish itself is
an insertion. Besides, as we shall see, the spirit of
the Psalm is national; in conformity with the truth
underlying the book, it is a Psalm of Israel as a whole.</p>

<p>If this be correct, we have the Book of Jonah as it came from the hands
of its author. The text is in wonderfully good condition, due to the
ease of the narrative and its late date. The Greek version
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>

<p class="captitle">THE GREAT REFUSAL</p>

<p class="csubtitle">J<span class="small">ONAH</span> i</p>

<p class="noindent">
We have now laid clear the lines upon which the
Book of Jonah was composed. Its purpose is
to illustrate God’s grace to the heathen in face of His
people’s refusal to fulfil their mission to them. The
author was led to achieve this purpose by a parable,
through which the prophet Jonah moves as the symbol
of his recusant, exiled, redeemed and still hardened
people. It is the Drama of Israel’s career, as the
Servant of God, in the most pathetic moments of that
career. A nation is stumbling on the highest road
nation was ever called to tread.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who is blind but My servant,</div>
<div class="verse">Or deaf as My messenger whom I have sent?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He that would read this Drama aright must remember
what lies behind the Great Refusal which forms its
tragedy. The cause of Israel’s recusancy was not only
wilfulness or cowardly sloth, but the horror of a whole
world given over to idolatry, the paralysing sense of
its irresistible force, of its cruel persecutions endured
for centuries, and of the long famine of Heaven’s
justice. These it was which had filled Israel’s eyes
too full of fever to see her duty. Only when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
feel, as the writer himself felt, all this tragic background
to his story are we able to appreciate the exquisite
gleams which he flashes across it: the generous
magnanimity of the heathen sailors, the repentance of
the heathen city, and, lighting from above, God’s pity
upon the dumb heathen multitudes.</p>

<p>The parable or drama divides itself into three parts:
The Prophet’s Flight and Turning (chap. i.); The Great
Fish and What it Means (chap. ii.); and The Repentance
of the City (chaps. iii. and iv.).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chief figure of the story is Jonah, son of
Amittai, from Gath-hepher in Galilee, a prophet identified
with that turn in Israel’s fortunes, by which she
began to defeat her Syrian oppressors, and win back
from them her own territories—a prophet, therefore,
of revenge, and from the most bitter of the heathen
wars. <i>And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah, the son
of Amittai, saying, Up, go to Niniveh, the Great City,
and cry out against her, for her evil is come up before
Me.</i> But <i>he arose to flee</i>. It was not the length of the
road, nor the danger of declaring Niniveh’s sin to
her face, which turned him, but the instinct that God
intended by him something else than Niniveh’s destruction;
and this instinct sprang from his knowledge
of God Himself. <i>Ah now, Jehovah, was not my word,
while I was yet upon mine own soil, at the time I made
ready to flee to Tarshish, this—that I knew that Thou
art a God gracious and tender and long-suffering,
plenteous in love and relenting of evil?</i><a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> Jonah interpreted
the Word which came to him by the Character
which he knew to be behind the Word. This is a
significant hint upon the method of revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
It would be rash to say that, in imputing even to
the historical Jonah the fear of God’s grace upon the
heathen, our author were guilty of an anachronism.<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a>
We have to do, however, with a greater than Jonah—the
nation herself. Though perhaps Israel little
reflected upon it, the instinct can never have been far
away that some day the grace of Jehovah might reach
the heathen too. Such an instinct, of course, must
have been almost stifled by hatred born of heathen
oppression, as well as by the intellectual scorn which
Israel came to feel for heathen idolatries. But we
may believe that it haunted even those dark periods
in which revenge upon the Gentiles seemed most just,
and their destruction the only means of establishing
God’s kingdom in the world. We know that it moved
uneasily even beneath the rigour of Jewish legalism.
For its secret was that faith in the essential grace of
God, which Israel gained very early and never lost,
and which was the spring of every new conviction and
every reform in her wonderful development. With a
subtle appreciation of all this, our author imputes the
instinct to Jonah from the outset. Jonah’s fear, that
after all the heathen may be spared, reflects the restless
apprehension even of the most exclusive of his
people—an apprehension which by the time our book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
was written seemed to be still more justified by God’s
long delay of doom upon the tyrants whom He had
promised to overthrow.</p>

<p>But to the natural man in Israel the possibility of
the heathen’s repentance was still so abhorrent, that
he turned his back upon it. <i>Jonah rose to flee to
Tarshish from the face of Jehovah.</i> In spite of recent
arguments to the contrary, the most probable location
of Tarshish is the generally accepted one, that it was
a Phœnician colony at the other end of the Mediterranean.
In any case it was far from the Holy Land;
and by going there the prophet would put the sea
between himself and his God. To the Hebrew
imagination there could not be a flight more remote.
Israel was essentially an inland people. They had
come up out of the desert, and they had practically
never yet touched the Mediterranean. They lived within
sight of it, but from ten to twenty miles of foreign
soil intervened between their mountains and its stormy
coast. The Jews had no traffic upon the sea, nor (but
for one sublime instance<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> to the contrary) had their
poets ever employed it except as a symbol of arrogance
and restless rebellion against the will of God.<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> It was
all this popular feeling of the distance and strangeness
of the sea which made our author choose it as the
scene of the prophet’s flight from the face of Israel’s
God. Jonah had to pass, too, through a foreign land
to get to the coast: upon the sea he would only be
among heathen. This was to be part of his conversion.
<i>He went down to Yapho, and found a ship going to
Tarshish, and paid the fare thereof, and embarked on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
to get away with</i> her crew<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> <i>to Tarshish—away from the
face of Jehovah</i>.</p>

<p>The scenes which follow are very vivid: the sudden
wind sweeping down from the very hills on which
Jonah believed he had left his God; the tempest; the
behaviour of the ship, so alive with effort that the
story attributes to her the feelings of a living thing—<i>she
thought she must be broken</i>; the despair of the
mariners, driven from the unity of their common task
to the hopeless diversity of their idolatry—<i>they cried
every man unto his own god</i>; the jettisoning of the
tackle of the ship to lighten her (as we should say,
they let the masts go by the board); the worn-out
prophet in the hull of the ship, sleeping like a stowaway;
the group gathered on the heaving deck to cast
the lot; the passenger’s confession, and the new fear
which fell upon the sailors from it; the reverence with
which these rude men ask the advice of him, in whose
guilt they feel not the offence to themselves, but the
sacredness to God; the awakening of the prophet’s
better self by their generous deference to him; how
he counsels to them his own sacrifice; their reluctance to
yield to this, and their return to the oars with increased
perseverance for his sake. But neither their generosity
nor their efforts avail. The prophet again offers himself,
and as their sacrifice he is thrown into the sea.</p>

<p><i>And Jehovah cast a wind<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> on the sea, and there was
a great tempest,<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> and the ship threatened<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> to break up.
And the sailors were afraid, and cried every man unto
his own god; and they cast the tackle of the ship into the
sea, to lighten it from upon them. But Jonah had gone
down to the bottom of the ship and lay fast asleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
And the captain of the ship<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> came to him, and said
to him, What art thou doing asleep? Up, call on thy
God; peradventure the God will be gracious to us, that we
perish not. And they said every man to his neighbour,
Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose
sake is this evil</i> come <i>upon us. So they cast lots, and the
lot fell on Jonah. And they said to him, Tell us now,<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a>
what is thy business, and whence comest thou? what
is thy land, and from what people art thou? And he
said to them, A Hebrew am I, and a worshipper of
the God of Heaven,<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> who made the sea and the dry
land. And the men feared greatly, and said to him,
What is this thou hast done? (for they knew he was
fleeing from the face of Jehovah, because he had told
them). And they said to him, What are we to do to
thee that the sea cease</i> raging <i>against us? For the sea
was surging higher and higher. And he said, Take
me and throw me into the sea; so shall the sea cease</i>
raging <i>against you: for I am sure that it is on my
account that this great tempest is</i> risen <i>upon you. And
the men laboured<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> with the oars to bring the ship to
land, and they could not, for the sea grew more and
more stormy against them. So they called on Jehovah
and said, Jehovah, let us not perish, we pray Thee, for
the life of this man, neither bring innocent blood upon
us: for Thou art Jehovah, Thou doest as Thou pleasest.
Then they took up Jonah and cast him into the sea,
and the sea stilled from its raging. But the men were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
in great awe of Jehovah, and sacrificed to Him and
vowed vows.</i></p>

<p>How very real it is and how very noble! We see
the storm, and then we forget the storm in the joy of
that generous contest between heathen and Hebrew.
But the glory of the passage is the change in Jonah
himself. It has been called his punishment and the
conversion of the heathen. Rather it is his own
conversion. He meets again not only God, but the
truth from which he fled. He not only meets that
truth, but he offers his life for it.</p>

<p>The art is consummate. The writer will first reduce
the prophet and the heathen whom he abhors to the
elements of their common humanity. As men have
sometimes seen upon a mass of wreckage or on an ice-floe
a number of wild animals, by nature foes to each
other, reduced to peace through their common danger,
so we descry the prophet and his natural enemies
upon the strained and breaking ship. In the midst of
the storm they are equally helpless, and they cast for all
the lot which has no respect of persons. But from
this the story passes quickly, to show how Jonah feels
not only the human kinship of these heathen with
himself, but their susceptibility to the knowledge of
his God. They pray to Jehovah as the God of the
sea and the dry land; while we may be sure that
the prophet’s confession, and the story of his own
relation to that God, forms as powerful an exhortation
to repentance as any he could have preached
in Niniveh. At least it produces the effects which
he has dreaded. In these sailors he sees heathen
turned to the fear of the Lord. All that he has fled
to avoid happens there before his eyes and through
his own mediation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
The climax is reached, however, neither when Jonah
feels his common humanity with the heathen nor
when he discovers their awe of his God, but when
in order to secure for them God’s sparing mercies
he offers his own life instead. <i>Take me up and cast
me into the sea; so shall the sea cease from</i> raging
<i>against you.</i> After their pity for him has wrestled
for a time with his honest entreaties, he becomes their
sacrifice.</p>

<p class="thb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all this story perhaps the most instructive passages
are those which lay bare to us the method of God’s
revelation. When we were children this was shown
to us in pictures of angels bending from heaven to
guide Isaiah’s pen, or to cry Jonah’s commission to
him through a trumpet. And when we grew older,
although we learned to dispense with that machinery,
yet its infection remained, and our conception of the
whole process was mechanical still. We thought of
the prophets as of another order of things; we
released them from our own laws of life and thought,
and we paid the penalty by losing all interest in them.
But the prophets were human, and their inspiration
came through experience. The source of it, as this
story shows, was God. Partly from His guidance
of their nation, partly through close communion with
Himself, they received new convictions of His character.
Yet they did not receive these mechanically. They
spake neither at the bidding of angels, nor like heathen
prophets in trance or ecstasy, but as <i>they were moved
by the Holy Ghost</i>. And the Spirit worked upon them
first as the influence of God’s character,<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> and second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
through the experience of life. God and life—these
are all the postulates for revelation.</p>

<p>At first Jonah fled from the truth, at last he laid
down his life for it. So God still forces us to the
acceptance of new light and the performance of strange
duties. Men turn from these, because of sloth or
prejudice, but in the end they have to face them, and
then at what a cost! In youth they shirk a self-denial
to which in some storm of later life they have to bend
with heavier, and often hopeless, hearts. For their
narrow prejudices and refusals, God punishes them by
bringing them into pain that stings, or into responsibility
for others that shames, these out of them. The
drama of life is thus intensified in interest and beauty;
characters emerge heroic and sublime.</p>

<p class="center small display">“But, oh the labour,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                                 O prince, the pain!”</p>

<p>Sometimes the neglected duty is at last achieved
only at the cost of a man’s breath; and the truth,
which might have been the bride of his youth and his
comrade through a long life, is recognised by him only
in the features of Death.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE GREAT FISH AND WHAT IT MEANS—THE PSALM</p>

<p class="csubtitle">J<span class="small">ONAH</span> ii</p>

<p class="noindent">
At this point in the tale appears the Great Fish.
<i>And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah,
and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
nights.</i></p>

<p>After the very natural story which we have followed,
this verse obtrudes itself with a shock of unreality and
grotesqueness. What an anticlimax! say some; what
a clumsy intrusion! So it is if Jonah be taken as an
individual. But if we keep in mind that he stands here,
not for himself, but for his nation, the difficulty and the
grotesqueness disappear. It is Israel’s ill-will to the
heathen, Israel’s refusal of her mission, Israel’s embarkation
on the stormy sea of the world’s politics,
which we have had described as Jonah’s. Upon her
flight from God’s will there followed her Exile, and from
her Exile, which was for a set period, she came back
to her own land, a people still, and still God’s servant
to the heathen. How was the author to express this
national death and resurrection? In conformity with
the popular language of his time, he had described
Israel’s turning from God’s will by her embarkation on
a stormy sea, always the symbol of the prophets for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
the tossing heathen world that was ready to engulf
her; and now to express her exile and return he sought
metaphors in the same rich poetry of the popular
imagination.</p>

<p>To the Israelite who watched from his hills that
stormy coast on which the waves hardly ever cease
to break in their impotent restlessness, the sea was a
symbol of arrogance and futile defiance to the will of
God. The popular mythology of the Semites had
filled it with turbulent monsters, snakes and dragons
who wallowed like its own waves, helpless against the
bounds set to them, or rose to wage war against the
gods in heaven and the great lights which they had
created; but a god slays them and casts their carcases
for meat and drink to the thirsty people of the desert.<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a>
It is a symbol of the perpetual war between light and
darkness; the dragons are the clouds, the slayer the
sun. A variant form, which approaches closely to that
of Jonah’s great fish, is still found in Palestine. In
May 1891 I witnessed at Hasbeya, on the western
skirts of Hermon, an eclipse of the moon. When the
shadow began to creep across her disc, there rose
from the village a hideous din of drums, metal pots
and planks of wood beaten together; guns were fired,
and there was much shouting. I was told that this
was done to terrify the great fish which was swallowing
the moon, and to make him disgorge her.</p>

<p>Now these purely natural myths were applied by
the prophets and poets of the Old Testament to the
illustration, not only of Jehovah’s sovereignty over the
storm and the night, but of His conquest of the heathen
powers who had enslaved His people.<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> Isaiah had
heard in the sea the confusion and rage of the peoples
against the bulwark which Jehovah set around Israel;<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>
but it is chiefly from the time of the Exile onward that
the myths themselves, with their cruel monsters and
the prey of these, are applied to the great heathen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>powers
and their captive, Israel. One prophet explicitly
describes the Exile of Israel as the swallowing
of the nation by the monster, the Babylonian tyrant,
whom God forces at last to disgorge its prey. Israel
says:<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> <i>Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured
me<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> and crushed me,<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528a" id="FNanchor_1528_1528a"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> ... he hath swallowed me
up like the Dragon, filling his belly, from my delights he
hath cast me out</i>. But Jehovah replies:<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> <i>I will punish
Bel in Babylon, and I will bring out of his mouth that
which he hath swallowed.... My people, go ye out of the
midst of her.</i></p>

<p>It has been justly remarked by Canon Cheyne that
this passage may be considered as the intervening link
between the original form of the myth and the application
of it made in the story of Jonah.<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> To this the
objection might be offered that in the story of Jonah
the <i>great fish</i> is not actually represented as the means
of the prophet’s temporary destruction, like the monster
in Jeremiah li., but rather as the vessel of his
deliverance.<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
This is true, yet it only means that our author
has still further adapted the very plastic material
offered him by this much transformed myth. But we
do not depend for our proof upon the comparison of a
single passage. Let the student of the Book of Jonah
read carefully the many passages of the Old Testament,
in which the sea or its monsters rage in vain against
Jehovah, or are harnessed and led about by Him; or
still more those passages in which His conquest of
these monsters is made to figure His conquest of the
heathen powers,<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a>—and the conclusion will appear irresistible
that the story of the <i>great fish</i> and of Jonah the
type of Israel is drawn from the same source. Such a
solution of the problem has one great advantage. It
relieves us of the grotesqueness which attaches to the
literal conception of the story, and of the necessity of
those painful efforts for accounting for a miracle which
have distorted the common-sense and even the orthodoxy
of so many commentators of the book.<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> We are
dealing, let us remember, with poetry—a poetry inspired
by one of the most sublime truths of the Old Testament,
but whose figures are drawn from the legends and myths
of the people to whom it is addressed. To treat this
as prose is not only to sin against the common-sense
which God has given us, but against the simple and
obvious intention of the author. It is blindness both
to reason and to Scripture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
These views are confirmed by an examination of the
Psalm or Prayer which is put into Jonah’s mouth while
he is yet in the fish. We have already seen what
grounds there are for believing that the Psalm belongs
to the author’s own plan, and from the beginning
appeared just where it does now.<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> But we may also
point out how, in consistence with its context, this
is a Psalm, not of an individual Israelite, but of the
nation as a whole. It is largely drawn from the
national liturgy.<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a> It is full of cries which we know,
though they are expressed in the singular number, to
have been used of the whole people, or at least of that
pious portion of them, who were Israel indeed. True
that in the original portion of the Psalm, and by far its
most beautiful verses, we seem to have the description
of a drowning man swept to the bottom of the sea.
But even here, the colossal scenery and the magnificent
hyperbole of the language suit not the experience of
an individual, but the extremities of that vast gulf of
exile into which a whole nation was plunged. It is a
nation’s carcase which rolls upon those infernal tides
that swirl among the roots of mountains and behind
the barred gates of earth. Finally, vv. 9 and 10 are
obviously a contrast, not between the individual prophet
and the heathen, but between the true Israel, who in
exile preserve their loyalty to Jehovah, and those
Jews who, forsaking their <i>covenant-love</i>, lapse to
idolatry. We find many parallels to this in exilic
and post-exilic literature.</p>

<p class="captitle">THE REPENTANCE OF THE CITY</p>

<p class="csubtitle">J<span class="small">ONAH</span> iii</p>

<p class="noindent">
Having learned, through suffering, his moral
kinship with the heathen, and having offered his
life for some of them, Jonah receives a second command
to go to Niniveh. He obeys, but with his prejudice
as strong as though it had never been humbled,
nor met by Gentile nobleness. The first part of his
story appears to have no consequences in the second.<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a>
But this is consistent with the writer’s purpose to treat
Jonah as if he were Israel. For, upon their return
from Exile, and in spite of all their new knowledge
of themselves and the world, Israel continued to
cherish their old grudge against the Gentiles.</p>

<p><i>And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second
time, saying, Up, go to Niniveh, the great city, and call
unto her with the call which I shall tell thee. And
Jonah arose and went to Niniveh, as Jehovah said.
Now Niniveh was a city great before God, three days’
journey</i> through and through.<a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a> <i>And Jonah began by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
going through the city one day’s journey, and he cried and
said, Forty<a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> days more and Niniveh shall be overturned</i>.</p>

<p>Opposite to Mosul, the well-known emporium of trade
on the right bank of the Upper Tigris, two high
artificial mounds now lift themselves from the otherwise
level plain. The more northerly takes the name
of Kujundschik, or “little lamb,” after the Turkish
village which couches pleasantly upon its north-eastern
slope. The other is called in the popular
dialect Nebi Yunus, “Prophet Jonah,” after a mosque
dedicated to him, which used to be a Christian
church; but the official name is Niniveh. These two
mounds are bound to each other on the west by a
broad brick wall, which extends beyond them both,
and is connected north and south by other walls,
with a circumference in all of about nine English miles.
The interval, including the mounds, was covered with
buildings, whose ruins still enable us to form some
idea of what was for centuries the wonder of the
world. Upon terraces and substructions of enormous
breadth rose storied palaces, arsenals, barracks,
libraries and temples. A lavish water system spread
in all directions from canals with massive embankments
and sluices. Gardens were lifted into mid-air, filled
with rich plants and rare and beautiful animals.
Alabaster, silver, gold and precious stones relieved the
dull masses of brick and flashed sunlight from every
frieze and battlement. The surrounding walls were so
broad that chariots could roll abreast on them. The
gates, and especially the river gates, were very massive.<a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
All this was Niniveh proper, whose glory the
Hebrews envied and over whose fall more than one
of their prophets exult. But this was not the Niniveh
to which our author saw Jonah come. Beyond the
walls were great suburbs,<a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> and beyond the suburbs
other towns, league upon league of dwellings, so
closely set upon the plain as to form one vast complex
of population, which is known to Scripture as <i>The
Great City</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> To judge from the ruins which still cover
the ground,<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> the circumference must have been about
sixty miles, or three days’ journey. It is these nameless
leagues of common dwellings which roll before us in
the story. None of those glories of Niniveh are
mentioned, of which other prophets speak, but the
only proofs offered to us of the city’s greatness are its
extent and its population.<a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a> Jonah is sent to three
days, not of mighty buildings, but of homes and
families, to the Niniveh, not of kings and their glories,
but of men, women and children, <i>besides much cattle</i>.
The palaces and temples he may pass in an hour or
two, but from sunrise to sunset he treads the dim
drab mazes where the people dwell.</p>

<p>When we open our hearts for heroic witness to
the truth there rush upon them glowing memories
of Moses before Pharaoh, of Elijah before Ahab, of
Stephen before the Sanhedrim, of Paul upon Areopagus,
of Galileo before the Inquisition, of Luther at the
Diet. But it takes a greater heroism to face the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
people than a king, to convert a nation than to
persuade a senate. Princes and assemblies of the
wise stimulate the imagination; they drive to bay all
the nobler passions of a solitary man. But there is
nothing to help the heart, and therefore its courage
is all the greater, which bears witness before those
endless masses, in monotone of life and colour, that
now paralyse the imagination like long stretches of
sand when the sea is out, and again terrify it like
the resistless rush of the flood beneath a hopeless
evening sky.</p>

<p>It is, then, with an art most fitted to his high
purpose that our author—unlike all other prophets,
whose aim was different—presents to us, not the
description of a great military power: king, nobles
and armed battalions: but the vision of those monotonous
millions. He strips his country’s foes of
everything foreign, everything provocative of envy
and hatred, and unfolds them to Israel only in their
teeming humanity.<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a></p>

<p>His next step is still more grand. For this teeming
humanity he claims the universal human possibility
of repentance—that and nothing more.</p>

<p>Under every form and character of human life,
beneath all needs and all habits, deeper than despair
and more native to man than sin itself, lies the power
of the heart to turn. It was this and not hope that
remained at the bottom of Pandora’s Box when every
other gift had fled. For this is the indispensable
secret of hope. It lies in every heart, needing indeed
some dream of Divine mercy, however far and vague,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
to rouse it; but when roused, neither ignorance of God,
nor pride, nor long obduracy of evil may withstand it.
It takes command of the whole nature of a man, and
speeds from heart to heart with a violence, that like
pain and death spares neither age nor rank nor degree
of culture. This primal human right is all our author
claims for the men of Niniveh. He has been blamed
for telling us an impossible thing, that a whole city
should be converted at the call of a single stranger;
and others have started up in his defence and quoted
cases in which large Oriental populations have actually
been stirred by the preaching of an alien in race and
religion; and then it has been replied, “Granted the
possibility, granted the fact in other cases, yet where
in history have we any trace of this alleged conversion
of all Niniveh?” and some scoff, “How could a Hebrew
have made himself articulate in one day to those
Assyrian multitudes?”</p>

<p>How long, O Lord, must Thy poetry suffer from
those who can only treat it as prose? On whatever
side they stand, sceptical or orthodox, they are equally
pedants, quenchers of the spiritual, creators of unbelief.</p>

<p>Our author, let us once for all understand, makes no
attempt to record an historical conversion of this vast
heathen city. For its men he claims only the primary
human possibility of repentance; expressing himself
not in this general abstract way, but as Orientals, to
whom an illustration is ever a proof, love to have it
done—by story or parable. With magnificent reserve
he has not gone further; but only told into the
prejudiced faces of his people, that out there, beyond
the Covenant, in the great world lying in darkness,
there live, not beings created for ignorance and hostility
to God, elect for destruction, but men with consciences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
and hearts, able to turn at His Word and to hope in
His Mercy—that to the farthest ends of the world, and
even on the high places of unrighteousness, Word and
Mercy work just as they do within the Covenant.</p>

<p>The fashion in which the repentance of Niniveh is
described is natural to the time of the writer. It is
a national repentance, of course, and though swelling
upwards from the people, it is confirmed and organised
by the authorities: for we are still in the Old Dispensation,
when the picture of a complete and thorough
repentance could hardly be otherwise conceived. And
the beasts are made to share its observance, as in the
Orient they always shared and still share in funeral
pomp and trappings.<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> It may have been, in addition,
a personal pleasure to our writer to record the part
of the animals in the movement. See how, later on,
he tells us that for their sake also God had pity upon
Niniveh.</p>

<p><i>And the men of Niniveh believed upon God, and cried
a fast, and from the greatest of them to the least of them
they put on sackcloth. And word came to the king of
Niniveh, and he rose off his throne, and cast his mantle
from upon him, and dressed in sackcloth and sat in the
dust. And he sent criers to say in Niniveh:—</i></p>

<p><i>By Order of the King and his Nobles, thus:—Man
and Beast, Oxen and Sheep, shall not taste anything,
neither eat nor drink water. But let them clothe themselves<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a>
in sackcloth, both man and beast, and call upon
God with power, and turn every man from his evil way
and from every wrong which they have in hand. Who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
knoweth but that God may<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> relent and turn from the fierceness
of His wrath, that we perish not?</i><a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a></p>

<p class="captitle">ISRAEL’S JEALOUSY OF JEHOVAH</p>

<p class="csubtitle">J<span class="small">ONAH</span> iv</p>

<p class="noindent">
Having illustrated the truth, that the Gentiles
are capable of repentance unto life, the Book
now describes the effect of their escape upon Jonah, and
closes by revealing God’s full heart upon the matter.</p>

<p>Jonah is very angry that Niniveh has been spared.
Is this (as some say) because his own word has not
been fulfilled? In Israel there was an accepted rule
that a prophet should be judged by the issue of his
predictions: <i>If thou say in thine heart, How shall we
know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?—when a
prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, if the thing
follow not nor come to pass, that is the thing which
Jehovah hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken
presumptuously, thou shalt have no reverence for him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a>
Was it this that stung Jonah? Did he ask for death
because men would say of him that when he predicted
Niniveh’s overthrow he was false and had not God’s
word? Of such fears there is no trace in the story.
Jonah never doubts that his word came from Jehovah,
nor dreads that other men will doubt. There is
absolutely no hint of anxiety as to his professional
reputation. But, on the contrary, Jonah says that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
from the first he had the foreboding, grounded upon
his knowledge of God’s character, that Niniveh would
be spared, and that it was from this issue he shrank
and fled to go to Tarshish. In short he could not, either
then or now, master his conviction that the heathen
should be destroyed. His grief, though foolish, is not
selfish. He is angry, not at the baffling of his word, but
at God’s forbearance with the foes and tyrants of Israel.</p>

<p>Now, as in all else, so in this, Jonah is the type of
his people. If we can judge from their literature
after the Exile, they were not troubled by the nonfulfilment
of prophecy, except as one item of what
was the problem of their faith—the continued prosperity
of the Gentiles. And this was not, what it appears
to be in some Psalms, only an intellectual problem
or an offence to their sense of justice. Nor could they
meet it always, as some of their prophets did, with a
supreme intellectual scorn of the heathen, and in the
proud confidence that they themselves were the favourites
of God. For the knowledge that God was infinitely
gracious haunted their pride; and from the very heart
of their faith arose a jealous fear that He would show
His grace to others than themselves. To us it may
be difficult to understand this temper. We have not
been trained to believe ourselves an elect people;
nor have we suffered at the hands of the heathen.
Yet, at least, we have contemporaries and fellow-Christians
among whom we may find still alive many
of the feelings against which the Book of Jonah was
written. Take the Oriental Churches of to-day.
Centuries of oppression have created in them an awful
hatred of the infidel, beneath whose power they are
hardly suffered to live. The barest justice calls for
the overthrow of their oppressors. That these share
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
a common humanity with themselves is a sense they
have nearly lost. For centuries they have had no
spiritual intercourse with them; to try to convert a
Mohammedan has been for twelve hundred years a
capital crime. It is not wonderful that Eastern
Christians should have long lost power to believe in
the conversion of infidels, and to feel that anything
is due but their destruction. The present writer once
asked a cultured and devout layman of the Greek
Church, Why then did God create so many Mohammedans?
The answer came hot and fast: To fill up
Hell! Analogous to this were the feelings of the
Jews towards the peoples who had conquered and
oppressed them. But the jealousy already alluded
to aggravated these feelings to a rigour no Christian
can ever share. What right had God to extend to
their oppressors His love for a people who alone had
witnessed and suffered for Him, to whom He had
bound Himself by so many exclusive promises, whom
He had called His Bride, His Darling, His Only
One? And yet the more Israel dwelt upon that Love
the more they were afraid of it. God had been so
gracious and so long-suffering to themselves that they
could not trust Him not to show these mercies to
others. In which case, what was the use of their
uniqueness and privilege? What worth was their
living any more? Israel might as well perish.</p>

<p>It is this subtle story of Israel’s jealousy of Jehovah,
and Jehovah’s gentle treatment of it, which we follow
in the last chapter of the book. The chapter starts
from Jonah’s confession of a fear of the results of God’s
lovingkindness and from his persuasion that, as this
spread to the heathen, the life of His servant spent
in opposition to the heathen was a worthless life; and
the chapter closes with God’s own vindication of His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
Love to His jealous prophet.</p>

<p><i>It was a great grief to Jonah, and he was angered;
and he prayed to Jehovah and said: Ah now, Jehovah,
while I was still upon mine own ground, at the time
that I prepared to flee to Tarshish, was not this my
word, that I knew Thee to be a God gracious and tender,
long-suffering and plenteous in love, relenting of evil?
And now, Jehovah, take, I pray Thee, my life from me,
for for me death is better than life.</i></p>

<p>In this impatience of life as well as in some subsequent
traits, the story of Jonah reflects that of Elijah.
But the difference between the two prophets was this,
that while Elijah was very jealous <i>for</i> Jehovah, Jonah
was very jealous <i>of</i> Him. Jonah could not bear to see
the love promised to Israel alone, and cherished by her,
bestowed equally upon her heathen oppressors. And
he behaved after the manner of jealousy and of the
heart that thinks itself insulted. He withdrew, and
sulked in solitude, and would take no responsibility
nor further interest in his work. Such men are best
treated by a caustic gentleness, a little humour, a little
rallying, a leaving to nature, and a taking unawares in
their own confessed prejudices. All these—I dare to
think even the humour—are present in God’s treatment
of Jonah. This is very natural and very beautiful.
Twice the Divine Voice speaks with a soft sarcasm: <i>Art
thou very angry?</i><a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> Then Jonah’s affections, turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
from man and God, are allowed their course with a bit of
nature, the fresh and green companion of his solitude;
and then when all his pity for this has been roused by
its destruction, that very pity is employed to awaken
his sympathy with God’s compassion for the great city,
and he is shown how he has denied to God the same
natural affection which he confesses to be so strong
in himself. But why try further to expound so clear
and obvious an argument?</p>

<p><i>But Jehovah said, Art thou <span class="norm">so</span> very angry?
<span class="norm">Jonah would not answer—how lifelike is his silence at this
point!—</span>but went out from the city and sat down before
it,<a name="FNanchor_1553_1553" id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> and made him there a booth and dwelt beneath it in
the shade, till he should see what happened in the city.
And Jehovah God prepared a gourd,<a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> and it grew up
above Jonah to be a shadow over his head....<a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> And
Jonah rejoiced in the gourd with a great joy. But as
dawn came up the next day God prepared a worm, and
<span class="norm">this</span><a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> wounded the gourd, that it perished. And it
came to pass, when the sun rose, that God prepared a
dry east-wind,<a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> and the sun smote on Jonah’s head, so
that he was faint, and begged for himself that he might
die,<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> saying, Better my dying than my living! And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
God said unto Jonah, Art thou so very angry about the
gourd? And he said, I am very angry—even unto
death! And Jehovah said: Thou carest for a gourd
for which thou hast not travailed, nor hast thou brought
it up, a thing that came in a night and in a night has
perished.<a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> And shall I not care for Niniveh, the Great
City,<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> in which there are more than twelve times ten
thousand human beings who know not their right hand
from their left, besides much cattle?</i></p>

<p>God has vindicated His love to the jealousy of those
who thought that it was theirs alone. And we are left
with this grand vague vision of the immeasurable city,
with its multitude of innocent children and cattle, and
God’s compassion brooding over all.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a> Stade (<i>Gesch.
des Volkes Israel</i>, I., pp.&nbsp;627 f.) denies to Manasseh the
reconstruction of the high places, the Baal altars and the Asheras,
for he does not believe that Hezekiah had succeeded in destroying
these. He takes 2&nbsp;Kings xxi. 3, which describes these
reconstructions, as a late interpolation rendered necessary to
reconcile the tradition that Hezekiah’s reforms had been quite in
the spirit of Deuteronomy, with the fact that there were still
high places in the land when Josiah began his reforms. Further,
Stade takes the rest of 2 Kings xxi. 2<i>b</i>-7 as also an
interpolation, but unlike verse&nbsp;3 an accurate account of
Manasseh’s idolatrous institutions, because it is corroborated by
the account of Josiah’s reforms, 2&nbsp;Kings xxiii. Stade also
discusses this passage in <i>Z.A.T.W.</i>, 1886, pp.&nbsp;186 ff.</p>

that we are now treating, not of
Northern Israel, but of the more stern and sullen Judæans.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15">[15]</a> Whether the parenthetical apostrophes to Jehovah as Maker of
the heavens, their hosts and all the powers of nature (Amos iv. 13,
v. 8, 9, ix. 5, 6), are also to be attributed to Manasseh’s reign is
more doubtful. Yet the following facts are to be observed: that
these passages are also (though to a less degree than v. 26 f.)
parenthetic; that their language seems of a later cast than that of the
time of Amos (see Vol. I., pp.
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43847/43847-h/43847-h.htm#Page_204">204</a>,
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43847/43847-h/43847-h.htm#Page_205">205</a>:
though here evidence is
adduced to show that the late features are probably post-exilic); and
that Jehovah is expressly named as the <i>Maker</i> of certain of the
stars. Similarly when Mohammed seeks to condemn the worship of
the heavenly bodies, he insists that God is their Maker. Koran, Sur.
41, 37: “To the signs of His Omnipotence belong night and day,
sun and moon; but do not pray to sun or moon, for God hath
created them.” Sur. 53, 50: “Because He is the Lord of Sirius.”
On the other side see Driver’s <i>Joel and Amos</i> (Cambridge Bible for
Schools Series), 1897, pp.&nbsp;118 f., 189.

<p class="fnote2">
How deeply Manasseh had planted in Israel the worship of the
heavenly host may be seen from the survival of the latter through
all the reforms of Josiah and the destruction of Jerusalem (Jer.&nbsp;vii. 18,
viii., xliv.; Ezek. viii. Cf. Stade, <i>Gesch. des V. Israel</i>, I.,
pp.&nbsp;629 ff.).</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16">[16]</a> The Jehovist and Elohist into the closely mortised JE. Stade
indeed assigns to the period of Manasseh Israel’s first acquaintance
with the Babylonian cosmogonies and myths which led to that
reconstruction of them in the spirit of her own religion which we
find in the Jehovistic portions of the beginning of Genesis (<i>Gesch.
des V. Isr.</i>, I., pp.&nbsp;630 ff.). But it may well be doubted (1) whether the
reign of Manasseh affords time for this assimilation, and (2) whether
it was likely that Assyrian and Babylonian theology could make
so deep and lasting impression upon the purer faith of Israel at a
time when the latter stood in such sharp hostility to all foreign
influences and was so bitterly persecuted by the parties in Israel
who had succumbed to these influences.</p>

Arabia for a subsequent attack upon Egypt. That this never came shows
more than anything else could Assyria’s consciousness of growing
weakness.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45">[45]</a> A stele of Nabonidus discovered at Hilleh and now in the museum
at Constantinople relates that in his third year, 553, the king restored
at Harran the temple of Sin, the moon-god, which the Medes had
destroyed fifty-four years before, <i>i.e.</i> 607. Whether the Medes did
this before, during or after the siege of Niniveh is uncertain, but the
approximate date of the siege, 608—606, is thus marvellously confirmed.
The stele affirms that the Medes alone took Niniveh, but that they
were called in by Marduk, the Babylonian god, to assist Nabopolassar
and avenge the deportation of his image by Sennacherib to Niniveh.
Messerschmidt (<i>Mittheilungen der Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft</i>, I.
1896) argues that the Medes were summoned by the Babylonians
while the latter were being sore pressed by the Assyrians. Winckler
had already (<i>Untersuch.</i>, pp.&nbsp;124 ff., 1889) urged that the Babylonians
would refrain from taking an active part in the overthrow of Niniveh, in
fear of incurring the guilt of sacrilege. Neither Messerschmidt’s paper,
nor Scheil’s (who describes the stele in the <i>Recueil des Travaux</i>,
XVIII. 1896), being accessible to me, I have written this note on the
information supplied by Rev. C. H. W. Johns, of Cambridge, in the
<i>Expository Times</i>, 1896, and by Prof. A. B. Davidson in App.&nbsp;I. to
<i>Nah., Hab. and Zeph.</i></p>

2 Kings xxiii. 24. The question whether Necho came by land
from Egypt or brought his troops in his fleet to Acre is hardly
answered by the fact that Josiah went to Megiddo to meet him.
But Megiddo on the whole tells more for the land than the sea. It
is not on the path from Acre to the Euphrates; it is the key of the
land-road from Egypt to the Euphrates. Josiah could have no hope
of stopping Pharaoh on the broad levels of Philistia; but at Megiddo
there was a narrow pass, and the only chance of arresting so large an
army as it moved in detachments. Josiah’s tactics were therefore
analogous to those of Saul, who also left his own territory and
marched north to Esdraelon, to meet his foe—and death.</p>

bewailed (Lam. iv. 20; Ezek. xvii. 22 ff.). He survived in captivity
till the death of Nebuchadrezzar, whose successor Evil-Merodach
in 561 took him from prison and gave him a place in his palace
(2 Kings xxv. 27 ff.).</p>

Kleinert in his Commentary in Lange’s <i>Bibelwerk</i>, and Delitzsch
in his article in Herzog’s <i>Real-Encyclopädie</i>², both offer a number of
inconclusive arguments. These are drawn from the position of
Zephaniah after Habakkuk, but, as we have seen, the order of the
Twelve is not always chronological; from the supposition that
Zephaniah i. 7, <i>Silence before the Lord Jehovah</i>, quotes Habakkuk ii.
20, <i>Keep silence before Him, all the earth</i>, but the phrase common to
both is too general to be decisive, and if borrowed by one or other
may just as well have been Zephaniah’s originally as Habakkuk’s;
from the phrase <i>remnant of Baal</i> (i. 4), as if this were appropriate
only after the Reform of 621, but it was quite as appropriate after
the beginnings of reform six years earlier; from the condemnation
of <i>the sons of the king</i> (i. 8), whom Delitzsch takes as Josiah’s sons,
who before the great Reform were too young to be condemned,
while later their characters did develop badly and judgment fell
upon all of them, but <i>sons of the king</i>, even if that be the correct
reading (LXX. <i>house of the king</i>), does not necessarily mean the
reigning monarch’s children; and from the assertion that Deuteronomy
is quoted in the first chapter of Zephaniah, and “so quoted as to show
that the prophet needs only to put the people in mind of it as something
supposed to be known,” but the verses cited in support of this
(viz. 13, 15, 17: cf. Deut. xxviii. 30 and 29) are too general in their
character to prove the assertion. See translation below.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85">[85]</a>
König has to deny the authenticity of this in order to make his
case for the reign of Jehoiakim. But nearly all critics take the phrase
as genuine.</p>

For inconclusive reasons Schwally, <i>Z.A.T.W.</i>,

Davidson, p.&nbsp;98.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87">[87]</a> Not much stress can be laid upon the phrase <i>I will cut off the

the destruction of Baal-worship, and not the uprooting of what has
been left over.</p>

If 695 be the date of the accession of Manasseh, being then twelve,
Amariah, Zephaniah’s great-grandfather, cannot have been more than
ten, that is, born in 705. His son Gedaliah was probably not born
before 689, his son Kushi probably not before 672, and his son
Zephaniah probably not before 650.</p>

The ideal of chap.&nbsp;i.—ii. 3, of the final security of a poor and lowly
remnant of Israel, “necessarily implies that they shall no longer be
threatened by hostility from without, and this condition is satisfied
by the prophet’s view of the impending judgment on the ancient
enemies of his nation,” <i>i.e.</i> those mentioned in ii. 4–15 (Robertson
Smith, <i>Encyc. Brit.</i>, art. “Zephaniah”).</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96">[96]</a>
See, however, Davidson for some linguistic reasons for taking the
two sections as one. Robertson Smith, also in 1888 (<i>Encyc. Brit.</i>,
art. “Zephaniah”), assumed (though not without pointing out the
possibility of the addition of other pieces to the genuine prophecies
of Zephaniah) that “a single leading motive runs through the whole”
book, and “the first two chapters would be incomplete without the
third, which moreover is certainly pre-exilic (vv.&nbsp;1–4) and presents
specific points of contact with what precedes, as well as a general
agreement in style and idea.”</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_97_97" id="Footnote_97_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97_97">[97]</a> Schwally (234) thinks that the epithet <span class="heb">צדיק</span> (ver.&nbsp;5) was first
applied to Jehovah by the Second Isaiah (xlv. 21, lxiv. 2, xlii. 21),
and became frequent from his time on. In disproof Budde (3398)
quotes Exod. ix. 27, Jer. xii. 1, Lam. i. 18. Schwally also points to
‎<span class="heb">נצדו</span> as borrowed from Aramaic.</p>

the unity of 9 and 10 with the context, but he has apparently mistaken
the meaning of ver.&nbsp;8 (231). That surely does not mean that the
nations are gathered in order to punish the godlessness of the Jews,
but that they may themselves be punished.</p>

his grandfather, except for some special purpose, or in order to
include some ancestor of note. Also the name Hezekiah is very
rare apart from the king. The number of names compounded with
Jah or Jehovah is another proof that the line is a royal one. The
omission of the phrase <i>king of Judah</i> after Hezekiah’s name proves
nothing; it may have been of purpose because the phrase has to
occur immediately again.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_106_106" id="Footnote_106_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_106_106">[106]</a> It was not till 652 that a league was made between the Palestine
princes and Psamtik I. against Assyria. This certainly would have
been the most natural year for a child to be named Kushi. But
that would set the birth of Zephaniah as late as 632, and his prophecy

have reached as to the date. We saw that one reason against putting
the Book of Zephaniah after the great Reforms of 621 was that it
betrayed no sign of their effects. But it might justly be answered that,
if Zephaniah prophesied before 621, his book ought to betray some
sign of the approach of reform. Still the explanation given above is
satisfactory.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_136_136" id="Footnote_136_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_136">[136]</a> <span class="heb">נִכְסָף</span>
is usually thought to have as its root meaning <i>to be pale</i>
or <i>colourless</i>, <i>i.e.</i> either white or black (<i>Journal of Phil.</i>, 14, 125),
whence <span class="heb">כֶּסֶף</span>, <i>silver</i> or <i>the pale metal</i>:
hence in the Qal to long for,
Job xiv. 15, Ps. xvii. 12; so Ni, Gen. xxxi. 30, Ps. lxxxiv. 3; and here
<i>to be ashamed</i>. But the derivation of the name for silver is quite
imaginary, and the colour of shame is red rather than white: cf. the
mod. Arab. saying, “They are a people that cannot blush; they have
no blood in their faces,” <i>i.e.</i> shameless. Indeed Schwally says (<i>in loco</i>),
“Die Bedeutung fahl, blass ist unerweislich.” Hence (in spite of the
meanings of the Aram. <span class="heb">כסף</span> both to lose colour and to be ashamed)
a derivation for the Hebrew is more probably to be found in the
root <i>kasaf</i>, to cut off. The Arab. <span class="arab">کﺴف</span>,
which in the classic tongue
means to cut a thread or eclipse the sun, is in colloquial Arabic to
give a rebuff, refuse a favour, disappoint, shame. In the forms
<i>inkasaf</i> and <i>itkasaf</i> it means to receive a rebuff, be disappointed, then
shy or timid, and <i>kasûf</i> means shame, shyness (as well as eclipse of
the sun). See Spiro’s <i>Arabic-English Vocabulary</i>. In Ps. lxxxiv. <span class="heb">נכסף</span>
is evidently used of unsatisfied longing (but see Cheyne), which is
also the proper meaning of the parallel <span class="heb">כלה</span>
(cf. other passages where
<span class="heb">כלה</span> is used of still unfulfilled or rebuffed hopes: Job xix. 27, Ps.
lxix. 4, cxix. 81, cxliii. 7). So in Ps. xvii. 4 <span class="heb">כסף</span> is used of a lion who is longing for, <i>i.e.</i> still disappointed in, his prey, and so in Job
xiv. 15.</p>

with a rising, and short with a falling, cadence. There is a
play upon the names, at least on the first and last—“Gazzah” or
“‘Azzah ‘Azubah”—which in English we might reproduce by the
use of Spenser’s word for “dreary”: <i>For Gaza ghastful shall be.</i>
“‘Eḳron te’aḳer.” LXX. Ἀκκαρων ἐκριζωθήσεταὶ (B), ἐκριφήσεται (A).
In the second line we have a slighter assonance, ‘Ashkĕlōn lishĕmamah.
In the third the verb is <span class="heb">יְגָרְשׁוּהָ</span>;
Bacher (<i>Z.A.T.W.</i>, 1891, 185 ff.)
points out that <span class="heb">גֵּרַשׁ</span> is not used of cities,
but of their populations or
of individual men, and suggests (from Abulwalid)
<span class="heb">יירשוה</span>, <i>shall possess
her</i>, as “a plausible emendation.” Schwally (<i>ibid.</i>, 260) prefers to
alter to <span class="heb">יְשָׁרְשׁוּהָ</span>,
with the remark that this is not only a good parallel
to <span class="heb">תעקר</span>, but suits the LXX. ἐκριφήσεται.—On the expression
<i>by noon</i>
see Davidson, <i>N. H. and Z.</i>, Appendix, Note 2, where he quotes a
parallel expression, in the Senjerli inscription, of Asarhaddon: that
he took Memphis by midday or in half a day (Schrader). This suits
the use of the phrase in Jer. xv. 8, where it is parallel to <i>suddenly</i>.</p>

as the metre requires a larger number of syllables in the first line of

The difficulty is the use of Canaan as synonymous with <i>Land of
the Philistines</i>. Nowhere else in the Old Testament is it expressly

is quite uncertain in meaning.
<span class="heb">גרם</span> is a root common to the Semitic languages and seems to mean
originally <i>to cut off</i>, while the noun <span class="heb">גרם</span>
is <i>a bone</i>. In Num. xxiv. 8
the Piel of the verb used with another word for bone means <i>to gnaw</i>,
<i>munch</i>. (The only other passage where it is used, Ezek. xxiii. 34, is
corrupt.) So some take it here: <i>they do not gnaw bones till morning</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> devour all at once; but this is awkward, and Schwally (198) has
proposed to omit the negative, <i>they do gnaw bones till morning</i>, yet in
that case surely the impf. and not the perf. tense would have been
used. The LXX. render <i>they do not leave over</i>, and it has been
attempted, though inconclusively, to derive this meaning from that of
<i>cutting off</i>, i.e. <i>laying aside</i> (the Arabic Form II. means, however, <i>to
leave behind</i>). Another line of meaning perhaps promises more. In
Aram. the verb means <i>to be the cause of anything, to bring about</i>, and
perhaps contains the idea of <i>deciding</i> (Levy <i>sub voce</i> compares κρίνω,
<i>cerno</i>); in Arab. it means, among other things, <i>to commit a crime, be
guilty</i>, but in mod. Arabic <i>to fine</i>. Now it is to be noticed that here
the expression is used of <i>judges</i>, and it may be there is an intentional
play upon the double possibility of meaning in the root.</p>

the whole earth, with which in his first discourse he had already
threatened Judah. He threatens her with it again in this eighth
verse, because, as he has said in the preceding ones, all other
warnings have failed. The eighth verse therefore follows naturally
upon the seventh, just as naturally as in Amos iv. ver.&nbsp;12, introduced
by the same <span class="heb">לָכֵן</span> as here, follows its predecessors. The next
two verses of the text, however, describe an opposite result: instead
of the destruction of the heathen, they picture their conversion, and it
is only in the eleventh verse that we return to the main subject of
the passage, Judah herself, who is represented (in harmony with the
close of Zephaniah’s first discourse) as reduced to a righteous and
pious remnant. Vv. 9 and 10 are therefore obviously a later insertion,

I. 122 ff., by Dr. Nestle: cf. <i>Hist. Geog.</i>, p.&nbsp;231, n.&nbsp;1. The previously
known readings of the passage were either geographically impossible,
as “He came from Elkesei beyond Jordan, towards Begabar of the
tribe of Simeon” (so in Paris edition, 1622, of the works of
St. Epiphanius, Vol. II., p.&nbsp;147: cf. Migne, <i>Patr. Gr.</i>, XLIII. 409);
or based on a misreading of the title of the book: “Nahum son of
Elkesaios was of Jesbe of the tribe of Simeon”; or indefinable:
“Nahum was of Elkesem beyond Betabarem of the tribe of Simeon”;
these last two from recensions of Epiphanius published in 1855 by
Tischendorf (quoted by Davidson, p.&nbsp;13). In the Στιχηρὸν τῶν ΙΒ´

who died 428 of 433 (Migne, <i>Patrologia Gr.</i>, XCIII. 1357), it is
said that Nahum was ἀπὸ Ἑλκεσεὶν (Helcesin) πέραν τοῦ τηνβαρεὶν

Christian texts quoted in the previous note fix it <i>beyond</i>, presumably
south or south-west of Beit-Jibrin, and in the tribe of Simeon. The
error “tribe of Simeon” does not matter, for the same fathers place

by Nahum in ii. 3 ff. as single, which was true of the siege in 625 <i>c.</i>, but
not of that of 607—6, when the Chaldeans joined the Medes, is disposed
of by the proof on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_22">22</a> above, that even in 607—6 the Medes carried

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_234_234" id="Footnote_234_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234_234">[234]</a> The phrase which is so often appealed to by both sides, i. 9,
<i>Jehovah maketh a complete end, not twice shall trouble arise</i>, is really
inconclusive. Hitzig maintains that if Nahum had written this after
the first and before the second siege of Niniveh he would have had
to say, “not thrice <i>shall trouble arise</i>.” This is not conclusive: the
prophet is looking only at the future and thinking of it—<i>not twice</i>
again <i>shall trouble arise</i>; and if there were really two sieges of
Niniveh, would the words <i>not twice</i> have been suffered to remain, if
they had been a confident prediction <i>before</i> the first siege? Besides,
the meaning of the phrase is not certain; it may be only a general
statement corresponding to what seems a general statement in the
first clause of the verse. Kuenen and others refer the <i>trouble</i> not
to that which is about to afflict Assyria, but to the long slavery and
slaughter which Judah has suffered at Assyria’s hands. Davidson
leaves it ambiguous.</p>

that the careful and able observations of Commander Jones, too much
neglected in his own country, have had justice done them by the
German Colonel Billerbeck in the work about to be cited. Then
there is the invaluable <i>Niniveh and its Remains</i>, by Layard. There
are also the works of Rawlinson and George Smith. And recently
Colonel Billerbeck, founding on these and other works, has published
an admirable monograph (lavishly illustrated by maps and pictures),
not only upon the military state of Assyria proper and of Niniveh
at this period, but upon the whole subject of Assyrian fortification
and art of besieging, as well as upon the course of the Median
invasions. It forms the larger part of an article to which Dr. Alfred
Jeremias contributes an introduction, and reconstruction with notes
of chaps. ii. and iii. of the Book of Nahum: “Der Untergang
Niniveh’s und die Weissagungschrift des Nahum von Elḳosh,” in

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_269_269" id="Footnote_269_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_269">[269]</a> If the above conception of chaps. ii. and iii. be correct, then
there is no need for such a re-arrangement of these verses as has
been proposed by Jeremias and Billerbeck. In order to produce a
continuous narrative of the progress of the siege, they bring forward
iii. 12–15 (describing the fall of the fortresses and gates of the land
and the call to the defence of the city), and place it immediately after
ii. 2, 4 (the description of the invader) and ii. 5–11 (the appearance
of chariots in the suburbs of the city, the opening of the floodgates,
the flight and the spoiling of the city). But if they believe that the
original gave an orderly account of the progress of the siege, why do
they not bring forward also iii. 2 f., which describe the arrival of the
foe under the city walls? The truth appears to be as stated above.
We have really two poems against Niniveh, chap.&nbsp;ii. and chap.&nbsp;iii.
They do not give an orderly description of the siege, but exult over
Niniveh’s imminent downfall, with gleams scattered here and there
of how this is to happen. Of these “impressions” of the coming
siege there are three, and in the order in which we now have them
they occur very naturally: ii. 5 ff., iii. 2 f., and iii. 12 ff.</p>

LXX. ἡνίαι; Vulg. <i>habenæ</i>. Some have thought that it means <i>scythes</i>—cf.
the Arabic <i>falad</i>, “to cut”—but the earliest notice of chariots
armed with scythes is at the battle of Cunaxa, and in Jewish literature
they do not appear before 2 Macc. xiii. 2. Cf. Jeremias, <i>op. cit.</i>, p.&nbsp;97,
where Billerbeck suggests that the words of Nahum are applicable to
the covered siege-engines, pictured on the Assyrian monuments, from
which the besiegers flung torches on the walls: cf. <i>ibid.</i>, p.&nbsp;167, n.&nbsp;***.
But from the parallelism of the verse it is more probable that
ordinary chariots are meant. The leading chariots were covered
with plates of metal (Billerbeck, p.&nbsp;167).</p>

meant, or the great, heavy spears which were thrust against the walls

book, long after the Babylonian destruction of Jews, it was
incredible that the Chaldean should be represented as the deliverer
of Israel, and so the account of him was placed where, while his call
to punish Israel for her sins was not emphasised, he should be pictured
as destined to doom; and so the prophecy originally referring to the
Assyrian was read of him. “This is possible,” says Davidson, “if
it be true criticism is not without its romance.”</p>

to Habakkuk, for the same reason for which Isa. lxiii. 7—lxiv. was
attached to the great prophecy of Restoration, viz. that the earlier
national troubles seemed to the Jewish Church to be typical of its own
sore troubles after the Return. &hellip; The lovely closing

in the <i>De Vitis Prophetarum</i> of (Pseud-) Epiphanius, <i>Epiph. Opera</i>,
ed. Paris, 1622, Vol. II., p.&nbsp;147, according to which Habakkuk belonged
to Βεθζοχηρ, which is probably Βεθζαχαριας of 1 Macc. vi. 32,
the modern Beit-Zakaryeh, a little to the north of Hebron, and placed
by this notice, as Nahum’s Elkosh is placed, in the tribe of Simeon.
His grave was shown in the neighbouring Keilah. The notice further
alleges that when Nebuchadrezzar came up to Jerusalem Habakkuk
fled to Ostracine, where he travelled in the country of the Ishmaelites;
but he returned after the fall of Jerusalem, and died in 538, two years
before the return of the exiles. <i>Bel and the Dragon</i> tells an extraordinary
story of his miraculous carriage of food to Daniel in the lions’

Nowack (1897) agrees that Cornill’s and
others’ conclusion that vv. 9–20 are not Habakkuk’s is too sweeping.
He takes the first, second and fourth of the taunt-songs as authentic,
but assigns the third (vv. 12–14) and the fifth (18–20) to another
hand. He deems the refrain, 8<i>b</i> and 17<i>b</i>, to be a gloss, and puts 19
before 18. Driver, <i>Introd.</i>, 6th ed., holds to the authenticity of all the
verses.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_396_396" id="Footnote_396_396"></a><a href="#FNanchor_396_396">[396]</a> The text reads, <i>For also wine is treacherous</i>, under which we
might be tempted to suspect some such original as, <i>As wine is
treacherous, so</i> (next line) <i>the proud fellow</i>, etc. (or, as Davidson
suggests, <i>Like wine is the treacherous dealer</i>), were it not that the
word <i>wine</i> appears neither in the Greek nor in the Syrian version.
Wellhausen suggests that <span class="heb">היין</span>, <i>wine</i>, is a corruption of <span class="heb">הוי</span>, with
which the verse, like vv. 6<i>b</i>, 9, 12, 15, 19, may have originally
begun, but according to 6<i>a</i> the taunt-songs, opening with <span class="heb">הוי</span>, start
first in 6<i>b</i>. Bredenkamp proposes <span class="heb">וְאֶפֶס כְּאַיִן</span>.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_397_397" id="Footnote_397_397"></a><a href="#FNanchor_397_397">[397]</a> The text is <span class="heb">ינוה</span>, a verb not elsewhere found in the Old Testament,

gives <i>is not satisfied</i>, and Wellhausen proposes to read <span class="heb">ירוה</span> with
that sense. See Davidson’s note on the verse.</p>

Ahab’s steward who hid the
prophets of the Lord, 1 Kings xviii. 3–7, 16; of a man in David’s
house, 1 Chron. xxvii. 19; a Levite in Josiah’s reign, 2 Chron. xxxiv.
12), is the name of several of the Jews who returned from exile:
Ezra viii. 9, the son of Jehi’el (in 1 Esdras viii. Ἀβαδιας); Neh. x. 6,
a priest, probably the same as the Obadiah in xii. 25, a porter, and
the <span class="heb">עַבְדָּא</span>, the singer, in xi. 17, who is called <span class="heb">עֹבַדְיָה</span> in 1 Chron. ix. 16. Another ‘Obadyah is given in the eleventh generation from
Saul, 1 Chron. viii. 38, ix. 44; another in the royal line in the time
of the Exile, iii. 21; a man of Issachar, vii. 3; a Gadite under David,
xii. 9; a <i>prince</i> under Jehoshaphat sent <i>to teach in the cities of Judah</i>,
2 Chron. xvii. 7. With the Massoretic points <span class="heb">עֹבַדְיָה</span> means worshipper
of Jehovah: cf. Obed-Edom, and so in the Greek form, Ὀβδειου, of Cod.
B. But other Codd., A, θ and <span class="heb">א</span>, give Ἀβδιου or Ἀβδειου,
and this, with the alternative Hebrew form <span class="heb">אַבְדָּא</span>
of Neh. xi. 17, suggests rather <span class="heb">עֶבֶד יָה</span>,
<i>servant of Jehovah</i>. The name as given in the title
is probably intended to be that of an historical individual, as in
the titles of all the other books; but which, or if any, of the above
mentioned it is impossible to say. Note, however, that it is the later
post-exilic form of the name that is used, in spite of the book occurring
among the pre-exilic prophets. Some, less probably, take the name
Obadyah to be symbolic of the prophetic character of the writer.</p>

Driver, Giesebrecht, Wildeboer and König. Cf. Jer. xlix. 9 with
Ob. 5; Jer. xlix. 14 ff. with Ob. 1–4. The opening of Ob. 1 ff. is held to
be more in its place than where it occurs in the middle of Jeremiah’s
passage. The language of Obadiah is “terser and more forcible.
Jeremiah seems to expand Obadiah, and parts of Jeremiah which
have no parallel in Obadiah are like Obadiah’s own style” (Driver).
This strong argument is enforced in detail by Pusey: “Out of the
sixteen verses of which the prophecy of Jeremiah against Edom
consists, four are identical with those of Obadiah; a fifth embodies
a verse of Obadiah’s; of the eleven which remain ten have some
turns of expression or idioms, more or fewer, which occur in Jeremiah,
either in these prophecies against foreign nations, or in his prophecies
generally. Now it would be wholly improbable that a
prophet, selecting verses out of the prophecy of Jeremiah, should
have selected precisely those which contain none of Jeremiah’s
characteristic expressions; whereas it perfectly fits in with the
supposition that Jeremiah interwove verses of Obadiah with his own
prophecy, that in verses so interwoven there is not one expression
which occurs elsewhere in Jeremiah.” Similarly Nowack, <i>Comm.</i>, 1897.</p>

translates <span class="heb">ספרד</span> by <span class="heb">אַסְפַּמְיָא</span> = Hispania. Hence the origin of the name Sephardim Jews. The supposition that it is Sparta need
hardly be noticed. Our decision must lie between two other regions—the
one in Asia Minor, the other in S.W. Media. <i>First</i>, in the
ancient Persian inscriptions there thrice occurs (great Behistun inscription,
I. 15; inscription of Darius, II. 12, 13; and inscription of
Darius from Naḳsh-i-Rustam) Çparda. It is connected with Janua or
Ionia and Katapatuka or Cappadocia (Schrader, <i>Cun. Inscr. and O. T.</i>,
Germ. ed., p.&nbsp;446; Eng., Vol. II., p.&nbsp;145); and Sayce shows that, called
Shaparda on a late cuneiform inscription of 275 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
it must have
lain in Bithynia or Galatia (<i>Higher Criticism and Monuments</i>, p.&nbsp;483).
Darius made it a satrapy. It is clear, as Cheyne says (<i>Founders of
O. T. Criticism</i>, p.&nbsp;312), that those who on other grounds are convinced
of the post-exilic origin of this part of Obadiah, of its origin in the
Persian period, will identify Sepharad with this Çparda, which both
he and Sayce do. But to those of us who hold that this part of
Obadiah is from the time of the Babylonian exile, as we have sought
to prove above on pp.&nbsp;171 f., then Sepharad cannot be Çparda, for
Nebuchadrezzar did not subdue Asia Minor and cannot have transported
Jews there. Are we then forced to give up our theory of the
date of Obadiah 10–21 in the Babylonian exile? By no means. For,
<i>second</i>, the inscriptions of Sargon, king of Assyria
(721—705 <span class="small">B.C.</span>),
mention a Shaparda, in S.W. Media towards Babylonia, a name
phonetically correspondent to <span class="heb">ספרד</span> (Schrader, <i>l.c.</i>),
and the identification
of the two is regarded as “exceedingly probable” by Fried.
Delitzsch (<i>Wo lag das Paradies?</i> p.&nbsp;249). But even if this should be
shown to be impossible, and if the identification Sepharad = Çparda
be proved, that would not oblige us to alter our opinion as to the
date of the whole of Obadiah 10–21, for it is possible that later
additions, including Sepharad, have been made to the passage.</p>

Darius, a name they take to be an error for that of Cyrus, brought
up the exiles with an escort of a thousand cavalry, starting in the first
month of the second year of the king’s reign. This passage, however,
is not beyond suspicion as a gloss (see Ryle on Ezra i. 11), and
even if genuine may be intended to describe a second contingent of
exiles despatched by Darius I. in his second year, 520. The names
given include that of Jesua, son of Josedec, and instead of Zerubbabel’s,
that of his son Joacim.</p>

have suggested that the Ahasuerus (Xerxes) and Artaxerxes mentioned
in Ezra iv. 6 and 7 ff. are not the successors of Darius I. who
bore these names, but titles of his predecessors Cambyses and the
Pseudo-Smerdis (see above, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_190">190</a>).
This view has been disposed of
by Kuenen, <i>Ges. Abhandl.</i>, pp.&nbsp;224 ff., and by Ryle, pp.&nbsp;65 ff. (<i>b</i>) The
attempt to prove that the Darius under whom the Temple was
built was not Darius I. (521—485), the predecessor of Xerxes I. and
Artaxerxes I. (485—424), but their successor once removed, Darius II.,
Nothus (423—404). So, in defence of the Book of Ezra, Imbert.

I regret that
neither Wellhausen’s answer to it, nor Kosters’ reply to Wellhausen,
was accessible to me in preparing this chapter. Nor did I read Mr.
Torrey’s <i>resume</i> of Wellhausen’s answer, or Wellhausen’s notes
to the second edition of his <i>Isr. u. Jüd. Geschichte</i>, till the
chapter was written. Previous to Kosters, the Return under Cyrus had
been called in question only by the very arbitrary French scholar M.
Vernes in 1889–90.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_571_571" id="Footnote_571_571"></a><a href="#FNanchor_571_571">[571]</a> ii. 6 ff. Eng., 10 ff. Heb.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_572_572" id="Footnote_572_572"></a><a href="#FNanchor_572_572">[572]</a> His chief grounds for this analysis are (1) that in v. 1–5 the Jews
are said to have <i>begun</i> to build the Temple in the second year of
Darius, while in v. 16 the foundation-stone is said to have been laid
under Cyrus; (2) the frequent want of connection throughout the
passage; (3) an alleged doublet: in v. 17—vi. 1 search is said to
have been made for the edict of Cyrus <i>in Babylon</i>, while in vi. 2 the
edict is said to have been found <i>in Ecbatana</i>. But (1) and (3) are
capable of very obvious explanations, and (2) is far from conclusive.—The
remainder of the Aramaic text, iv. 8–24, Kosters seeks to prove is
by the Chronicler or Compiler himself. As Torrey (<i>op. cit.</i>, p.&nbsp;11) has
shown, this “is as unlikely as possible.” At the most he may have
made additions to the Aramaic document.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_573_573" id="Footnote_573_573"></a><a href="#FNanchor_573_573">[573]</a> Ezra v. 16.</p>

the Aramaic document about the rebuilding of the Temple is therefore
a pious invention of a literal fulfilment of prophecy. To this
opinion Cheyne adheres (<i>Introd. to the Book of Isaiah</i>, 1895, p.&nbsp;xxxviii),
and adds the further assumption that the Chronicler, being “shocked
at the ascription to Cyrus (for the Judæan builders have no credit
given them) of what must, he thought, have been at least equally due
to the zeal of the exiles,” invented his story in the earlier chapters
of Ezra as to the part the exiles themselves took in the rebuilding.
It will be noticed that these assumptions have precisely the value
of such. They are merely the imputation of motives, more or less
probable to the writers of certain statements, and may therefore be
fairly met by probabilities from the other side. But of this more
later on.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_576_576" id="Footnote_576_576"></a><a href="#FNanchor_576_576">[576]</a> This is the usual opinion of critics, who yet hold it to be genuine—<i>e.g.</i>
Ryle.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_577_577" id="Footnote_577_577"></a><a href="#FNanchor_577_577">[577]</a> He seeks to argue that a List of Exiles returned under Cyrus in
536 could be of no use for Nehemiah’s purpose to obtain in 445 a
census of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; but surely, if in his efforts to
make a census Nehemiah discovered the existence of such a List, it
was natural for him to give it as the basis of his inquiry, or (because
the List—see above, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_203">203</a>—contains elements from Nehemiah’s own
time) to enlarge it and bring it down to date. But Dr. Kosters thinks
also that, as Nehemiah would never have broken the connection of
his memoirs with such a List, the latter must have been inserted by
the Compiler, who at this point grew weary of the discursiveness of
the memoirs, broke from them, and then—inserted this lengthy List!
This is simply incredible—that he should seek to atone for the
diffuseness of Nehemiah’s memoirs by the intrusion of a very long
catalogue which had no relevance to the point at which he broke
them off.</p>

all Jews as well who were left of ancient Israel.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_583_583" id="Footnote_583_583"></a><a href="#FNanchor_583_583">[583]</a> Compare Cheyne, <i>Introduction to the Book of Isaiah</i>, 1895, xxxv. ff.,
who says that in the main points Kosters’ conclusions “appear so
inevitable” that he has “constantly presupposed them” in dealing
with chaps. lvi.—lxvi. of Isaiah; and Torrey, <i>op. cit.</i>, 1896, p.&nbsp;53:
“Kosters has demonstrated, from the testimony of Haggai and
Zechariah, that Zerubbabel and Jeshua were not returned exiles;
and furthermore, that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah knew
nothing of an important return of exiles from Babylonia.” Cf. also
Wildeboer, <i>Litteratur des A. T.</i>, pp.&nbsp;291&nbsp;ff.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_585_585" id="Footnote_585_585"></a><a href="#FNanchor_585_585">[585]</a> Of course it is always possible that, if there had been no great
Return from Babylon under Cyrus, the community at Jerusalem in
520 had not heard of the prophecies of the Second Isaiah.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_586_586" id="Footnote_586_586"></a><a href="#FNanchor_586_586">[586]</a> This argument, it is true, does not fully account for the curious
fact that Haggai and Zechariah never call the Jewish community at
Jerusalem by a name significant of their return from exile. But in
reference to this it ought to be noted that even the Aramaic document
in the Book of Ezra which records the Return under Cyrus does not
call the builders of the Temple by any name which implies that they
have come up from exile, but styles them simply <i>the Jews who were
in Judah and Jerusalem</i> (Ezra v. 1), in contrast to the Jews who were
in foreign lands.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_587_587" id="Footnote_587_587"></a><a href="#FNanchor_587_587">[587]</a> Indeed, why does he ignore the whole Exile itself if no return

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_592_592" id="Footnote_592_592"></a><a href="#FNanchor_592_592">[592]</a> Since writing the above I have seen the relevant notes to the
second edition of Wellhausen’s <i>Gesch.</i>, pp.&nbsp;155 and 160. “The refounding
of Jerusalem and the Temple cannot have started from the
Jews left behind in Palestine.” “The remnant left in the land would
have restored the old popular cultus of the high places. Instead of
that we find even before Ezra the legitimate cultus and the hierocracy
in Jerusalem: in the Temple-service proper Ezra discovers nothing
to reform. Without the leaven of the Gôlah the Judaism of Palestine
is in its origin incomprehensible.”</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_593_593" id="Footnote_593_593"></a><a href="#FNanchor_593_593">[593]</a> The inscription of Cyrus is sometimes quoted to this effect: cf.
P. Hay Hunter, <i>op. cit.</i>, I. 35. But it would seem that the statement
of Cyrus is limited to the restoration of Assyrian idols and their
worshippers to Assur and Akkad. Still, what he did in this case
furnishes a strong argument for the probability of his having done
the same in the case of the Jews.</p>

earnestness of Haggai and Zechariah (who cannot have stood alone)
implies the existence of a higher religious element at Jerusalem long
before 432 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Whence came this higher element but from its

all, <i>e.g.</i> that between <span class="heb">מפני</span> and <span class="heb">לפני</span>. But here are the others. He
asserts that while chap.&nbsp;i. calls <i>oil and wine</i> “yiṣhar and tîrôsh,”
chap.&nbsp;ii. (10) 11–19 calls them “yayin and shemen.” But he overlooks
the fact that the former pair of names, meaning the newly
pressed oil and wine, suit their connection, in which the fruits of the
earth are being catalogued, i. 11, while the latter pair, meaning the
finished wine and oil, equally suit their connection, in which articles
of food are being catalogued, ii. 12. Equally futile is the distinction
drawn between i. 9, which speaks of bringing the crops <i>to the house</i>,
or as we should say <i>home</i>, and ii. 19, which speaks of seed being <i>in
the barn</i>. Again, what is to be said of a critic who adduces in
evidence of distinction of authorship the fact that i. 6 employs the
verb labhash, <i>to clothe</i>, while ii. 12 uses beged for <i>garment</i>, and who
actually puts in brackets the root bagad, as if it anywhere in the
Old Testament meant <i>to clothe</i>! Again, Andrée remarks that while
ii. (10) 11–19 does not employ the epithet <i>Jehovah of Hosts</i>, but only
<i>Jehovah</i>, the rest of the book frequently uses the former; but he
omits to observe that the rest of the book, besides using <i>Jehovah of
Hosts</i>, often uses the name Jehovah alone [the phrase in ii. (10) 11–19
is <span class="heb">נאם יהוה</span>, and occurs twice ii. 14, 17; but the rest of the book has
also <span class="heb">נאם יהוה</span>, ii. 4; and besides <span class="heb">דבר יהוה</span>, i. 1, ii. 1, ii. 20; <span class="heb">אמר יהוה</span>,
i. 8; and <span class="heb">יהוה אלהים</span> and <span class="heb">מפני יהוה</span>, i. 12]. Again, Andrée observes
that while the rest of the book designates Israel always by <span class="heb">עם</span> and
the heathen by <span class="heb">גוי</span>, chap.&nbsp;ii. (10) 11–19, in ver.&nbsp;14, uses both terms of
Israel. Yet in this latter case <span class="heb">גוי</span> is used only in parallel to <span class="heb">עם</span>,
as frequently in other parts of the Old Testament. Again, that while
in the rest of the book Haggai is called the prophet (the doubtful
i. 13 may be omitted), he is simply named in ii. (10) 11–19, means
nothing, for the name here occurs only in introducing his contribution
to a conversation, in recording which it was natural to omit titles.
Similarly insignificant is the fact that while the rest of the book
mentions only <i>the High Priest</i>, chap.&nbsp;ii. (10) 11–19 talks only of <i>the
priests</i>: because here again each is suitable to the connection.—Two or
three of Andrée’s alleged grounds (such as that from the names for
wine and oil and that from labhash and beged) are enough to discredit
his whole case.</p>

(Wellhausen), <span class="heb">יַעַן לִקְחֹתָם שַׁחַר</span> for <span class="heb">יַעַן לְקַחְתֶּם שֹׁחַד</span>, <i>because

from Amos v. 10: <span class="heb">שָׂנְאוּ בַשַׁעַר מוֹכִיחַ</span>, <i>they hate him who reproves in
the gate</i>. These may have been inserted into the Hebrew text by
some one puzzled to know what the source of the people’s pollution
was, and who absurdly found it in sins which in Haggai’s time it
was impossible to impute to them. The middle clause, <span class="heb">יִתְעַנּוּ מִפְּנֵי עַצְבֵיהֶם</span>,
<i>they vex themselves with their labours</i>, is suitable to the sense

so much has been founded: <span class="heb">לְמִן־הַיּוֹם אֲשֶׁר־יֻסַּד הֵיכַל־יְהוָֹה</span>. Does
this clause, in simple parallel to the previous one, describe the day on
which the prophet was speaking, <i>the twenty-fourth day of the ninth
month</i>, the <i>terminus a quo</i> of the people’s retrospect? In that case
Haggai regards the foundation-stone of the Temple as laid on the
twenty-fourth day of the ninth month 520 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and does not know,
or at least ignores, any previous laying of a foundation-stone. So
Kuenen, Kosters, Andrée, etc. Or does <span class="heb">למן</span> signify <i>up to the time
the foundation-stone was laid</i>, and state a <i>terminus ad quem</i> for the
people’s retrospect? So Ewald and others, who therefore find in
the verse a proof that Haggai knew of an earlier laying of the
foundation-stone. But that <span class="heb">למן</span> is ever used
for <span class="heb">ועד</span> cannot be
proved, and indeed is disproved by Jer. vii. 7, where it occurs in contrast
to <span class="heb">ועד</span>. Van Hoonacker finds the same, but in a more subtle translation
of <span class="heb" dir="ltr">למן</span>. <span class="heb">מן</span>, he says,
is never used except of a date distant from
the speaker or writer of it; <span class="heb">למן</span> (if I understand him aright) refers
therefore to a date previous to Haggai to which the people’s thoughts
are directed by the <span class="heb">ל</span> and then brought back from it to the date at
which he was speaking by means of the <span class="heb">מן</span>: “la préposition
<span class="heb">ל</span> signifie
la direction de l’esprit vers une époque du passé d’où il est
ramené par la préposition <span class="heb">מן</span>.” But surely <span class="heb">מן</span> can be used (as
indeed Haggai has just used it) to signify extension backwards from
the standpoint of the speaker; and although in the passages cited
by Van Hoonacker of the use of <span class="heb">למן</span> it always refers to a past
date—Deut. ix. 7, Judg. xix. 30, 2 Sam. vi. 11, Jer. vii. 7 and 25—still,
as it is there nothing but a pleonastic form for <span class="heb">מן</span>, it surely
might be employed as <span class="heb">מן</span> is sometimes employed for departure from
the present backwards. Nor in any case is it used to express what
Van Hoonacker seeks to draw from it here, the idea of direction of
the mind to a past event and then an immediate return from that.
Had Haggai wished to express that idea he would have phrased it
thus: <span class="heb">למן היום אשר יסד היכל יהוה ועד היום הזה</span> (as Kosters
remarks). Besides, as Kosters has pointed out (pp.&nbsp;7 ff. of the
Germ. trans. of <i>Het Herstel</i>, etc.), even if Van Hoonacker’s translation
of <span class="heb">למן</span> were correct, the context would show that it might refer
only to a laying of the foundation-stone since Haggai’s first address
to the people, and therefore the question of an earlier foundation-stone
under Cyrus would remain unsolved. Consequently Haggai
ii. 18 cannot be quoted as a proof of the latter.

Christian traditions of him are as unfounded as those of other
prophets. According to the Jews he was, of course, a member of
the mythical Great Synagogue. See above on Haggai, pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_232">232</a> f. As
in the case of the prophets we have already treated, the Christian
traditions of Zechariah are found in (Pseud-)Epiphanius, <i>De Vitis
Prophetarum</i>, Dorotheus, and Hesychius, as quoted above, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_80">80</a>.
They amount to this, that Zechariah, after predicting in Babylon
the birth of Zerubbabel, and to Cyrus his victory over Crœsus and
his treatment of the Jews, came in his old age to Jerusalem,
prophesied, died and was buried near Beit-Jibrin—another instance
of the curious relegation by Christian tradition of the birth and burial
places of so many of the prophets to that neighbourhood. Compare
Beit-Zakharya, 12 miles from Beit-Jibrin. Hesychius says he was
born in Gilead. Dorotheus confuses him, as the Jews did, with
Zechariah of Isa. viii. 1.

<p class="fnote2">
Zechariah was certainly not the Zechariah whom our Lord describes
as slain between the Temple and the Altar (Matt. xxiii. 35; Luke xi. 51).
In the former passage alone is this Zechariah called the son of
Barachiah. In the <i>Evang. Nazar.</i> Jerome read <i>the son of Yehoyada</i>.
Both readings may be insertions. According to 2 Chron. xxiv. 21,
in the reign of Joash, Zechariah, the son of Yehoyada the priest, was
stoned in the court of the Temple, and according to Josephus (IV.
<i>Wars</i>, v. 4), in the year 68 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Zechariah son of Baruch was
assassinated in the Temple by two zealots. The latter murder may,
as Marti remarks (pp.&nbsp;58 f.), have led to the insertion of Barachiah
into Matt. xxiii. 35.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_833_833" id="Footnote_833_833"></a><a href="#FNanchor_833_833">[833]</a> So LXX. Heb. has a degraded grammatical form, <i>clothe thyself</i>

latter.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_834_834" id="Footnote_834_834"></a><a href="#FNanchor_834_834">[834]</a> LXX. omits <i>I said</i> and reads <i>Let them put</i>
as another imperative,
<i>Do ye put</i>, following on the two of the previous verse. Wellhausen
adopts this (reading <span class="heb">שימו</span> for <span class="heb">ישימו</span>). Though it is difficult to see
how <span class="heb">ואמר</span> dropped out of the text if once there, it is equally so to
understand why if not original it was inserted. The whole passage
has been tampered with. If we accept the Massoretic text, then we
have a sympathetic interference in the vision of the dreamer himself
which is very natural; and he speaks, as is proper, not in the direct,
but indirect, imperative, <i>Let them put</i>.</p>

men (Job xxix. 14), means something wound round and round the
head (cf. the use of <span class="heb">צנף</span> to form like a ball in Isa. xxii. 18, and
the use of <span class="heb">חבשׁ</span> (to wind) to express the putting on of the headdress
(Ezek. xvi. 10, etc.)). Hence <i>turban</i> seems to be the proper
rendering. Another form from the same root, <span class="heb">מצנפת</span>, is the name
of the headdress of the Prince of Israel (Ezek. xxi. 31); and in the
Priestly Codex of the Pentateuch the headdress of the high priest

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_861_861" id="Footnote_861_861"></a><a href="#FNanchor_861_861">[861]</a> A group of difficult expressions. The verb <span class="heb">נִקָּה</span>
is Ni. of a
root which originally had the physical meaning to <i>clean out of a
place</i>, and this Ni. is so used of a plundered town in Isa. iii. 26.
But its more usual meaning is to be spoken free from guilt (Psalm
xix. 14, etc.). Most commentators take it here in the physical sense,
Hitzig quoting the use of καθαρίζω in Mark vii. 19. <span class="heb">מִזֶה כָמוֹהָ</span>
are variously rendered. <span class="heb">מזה</span> is mostly understood
as locative, <i>hence</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> from the land just mentioned, but some take it with <i>steal</i> (Hitzig),
some with <i>cleaned out</i> (Ewald, Orelli, etc.). <span class="heb">כָמוֹהָ</span>
is rendered <i>like it</i>—the
flying roll (Ewald, Orelli), which cannot be, since the roll flies
upon the face of the land, and the sinner is to be purged out of it;
or in accordance with the roll or its curse (Jerome, Köhler). But
Wellhausen reads <span class="heb">מִזֶה כַמֶּה</span>, and takes
<span class="heb">נִקָּה</span> in its usual meaning
and in the past tense, and renders <i>Every thief has for long remained
unpunished</i>; and so in the next clause. So, too, Nowack. LXX.
<i>Every thief shall be condemned to death</i>, ἕως θανάτου ἐκδιθήσεται.</p>

reduce the redundancies of the Visions is to delete the most characteristic
feature of their style. Besides, Wellhausen’s result gives no
sense. The prophet would not be asked to see what a bushel is:
the angel is there to tell him this. So Wellhausen in his translation
has to omit the <span class="heb">מה</span> of ver.&nbsp;5, while telling us in his note to replace

but there is good reason to suppose that the crown was meant for
Zerubbabel, but that the name of Joshua was inserted instead in a
later age, when the high priest was also the king—see below, note.
For these reasons Ewald had previously supposed that the whole verse
was genuine, but that there had fallen out of it the words <i>and on the
head of Zerubbabel</i>. Ewald found a proof of this in the plural form
<span class="heb">עטרות</span>, which he rendered <i>crowns</i>. (So also Wildeboer, <i>A. T.</i>
<i>Litteratur</i>, p.&nbsp;297.) But <span class="heb">עטרות</span> is to be rendered <i>crown</i>; see ver.&nbsp;11,

the rest of the received text cannot be harmonised. There were two:
one is the priest just mentioned who is to be at the right hand of the
crowned. The received text makes this crowned one to be the high
priest Joshua. But if there are two and the priest is only secondary,
the crowned one must be Zerubbabel, whom Haggai has already
designated as Messiah. Nor is it difficult to see why, in a later age,
when the high priest was sovereign in Israel, Joshua’s name should
have been inserted in place of Zerubbabel’s, and at the same time the
phrase <i>priest at his right hand</i>, to which the LXX. testifies in harmony
with <i>the two of them</i>, should have been altered to the reading of the
received text, <i>priest upon his throne</i>. With the above agree Smend,

His function is as the minister of God to try the sincerity of man;
hence when his work of trial is over he is no more found, and no

name, requiring the name or title of deity in front of it, and Marti
proposes to find this in the last syllable of Bethel, and to read
’El-sar’eser. It is tempting to find in the first syllable of Bethel the
remnant of the phrase <i>to the house of Jehovah</i>.</p>

To judge from the analogy of other cases
of the same formation (<i>e.g.</i> Abiyah = Jehovah is Father, and not
Father of Jehovah), this name, if ever extant, could not have borne
the meaning, which Robertson Smith, Cornill, Kirkpatrick, etc., suppose
it must have done, of <i>Angel of Jehovah</i>. These scholars, it should be
added, oppose, for various reasons, the theory that it is a proper
name.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_954_954" id="Footnote_954_954"></a><a href="#FNanchor_954_954">[954]</a> So (besides Calvin, who takes it as a title) even Hengstenberg in
his <i>Christology of the O. T.</i>, Ewald, Kuenen, Reuss, Stade, Rob. Smith,
Cornill, Wellhausen, Kirkpatrick (probably), Wildeboer, Nowack. On
the other side Hitzig, Vatke, Nägelsbach and Volck (in Herzog), Von
Orelli, Pusey and Robertson hold it to be a personal name—Pusey with
this qualification, “that the prophet may have framed it for himself,”
similarly Orelli. They support their opinion by the fact that even
the LXX. entitle the book Μαλαχιας; that the word was regarded
as a proper name in the early Church, and that it is a possible name
for a Hebrew. In opposition to the hypothesis that it was borrowed
from chap.&nbsp;iii. 1, Hitzig suggests the converse that in the latter the
prophet plays upon his own name. None of these critics, however,
meets the objections to the name drawn from the peculiar character of
the title and its relations to Zech. ix. 1, xii. 1. The supposed name
of the prophet gave rise to the legend supported by many of the
Fathers that Malachi, like Haggai and John the Baptist, was an
incarnate angel. This is stated and condemned by Jerome, <i>Comm. ad
Hag.</i> i. 13, but held by Origen, Tertullian and others. The existence
of such an opinion is itself proof for the impersonal character of the
name. As in the case of the rest of the prophets, Christian tradition
furnishes the prophet with the outline of a biography. See (Pseud-)Epiphanius
and other writers quoted above, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_232">232</a>.</p>

incorporated in our Book of Ezra, and there is no reason to doubt
its reality. In that document we have already found, in spite of its
comparatively late date, much that is accurate history. See above,
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_212">212</a>. And it is clear that, the Temple being finished, the Jews
must have drawn upon themselves the same religious envy of the
Samaritans which had previously delayed the construction of the
Temple. To meet it, what more natural than that the Jews should
have attempted to raise the walls of their city? It is almost
impossible to believe that they who had achieved the construction
of the Temple in 516 should not, in the next fifty years, make some
effort to raise their fallen walls. And indeed Nehemiah’s account of
his own work almost necessarily implies that they had done so, for
what he did after 445 was not to build new walls, but rather to
repair shattered ones.</p>

Heb. literally: <i>And not one did, and
a remnant of spirit was his</i>; which (1) A.V. renders: <i>And did not
he make one? Yet he had the residue of the spirit</i>, which Pusey
accepts and applies to Adam and Eve, interpreting the second clause as
<i>the breath of life</i>, by which Adam <i>became a living soul</i>
(Gen. ii. 7). In Gen. i. 27 Adam and Eve are called one. In that case
the meaning would be that the law of marriage was prior to that of
divorce, as in the words of our Lord, Matt. xix. 4–6. (2) The Hebrew
might be rendered, <i>Not one has done this who had any spirit left in
him</i>. So Hitzig and Orelli. In that case the following clauses of the
verse are referred to Abraham. <i>“But what about the One?”</i> (LXX.
insert <i>ye say</i> after <i>But</i>)—the one who did put away his
wife. Answer: <i>He was seeking a Divine seed</i>. The objection to this
interpretation is that Abraham did not cast off the wife of his youth,
Sarah, but the foreigner Hagar. (3) Ewald made a very different
proposal: <i>And has not One created them, and all the Spirit</i> (cf.
Zeph. i. 4) <i>is His? And what doth the One seek? A Divine seed.</i>
So Reinke. Similarly Kirkpatrick (<i>Doct. of the Proph.</i>, p.&nbsp;502):
<i>And did not One make</i>[you both]<i>? And why</i> [did]<i>the One
</i>[do so]<i>? Seeking a goodly seed</i>. (4) Wellhausen goes further
along the same line. Reading <span class="heb">הלא</span> for <span
class="heb">ולא</span>, and <span class="heb">וישאר</span> for <span
class="heb">ושאר</span>, and <span class="heb">לנו</span> for <span
class="heb">לו</span>, he translates: <i>Hath not the same God created
and sustained your (? our) breath? And what does He desire? A seed of
God.</i></p>

in Hebrew to cook (cf. Ezek. xxiv. 5), and in other forms always with that meaning down to
the Priestly Writing and “Zech.” ix.—xiv., is used here in the sense
of <i>ripen</i>, which is frequent in Aram., but does not occur elsewhere
in O. T. Besides, Joel uses for the first personal
pronoun <span class="heb">אני</span>—ii.&nbsp;27
(<i>bis</i>), iv. 10, 17—which is by far the most usual form with later
writers, and not <span class="heb">אנכי</span>, preferred by pre-exilic writers. (See below
on the language of Jonah.)</p>

proposal to place Joel in the last years of Josiah. Some of his
arguments (<i>e.g.</i> that Joel is placed among the first of the Twelve) we
have already answered. He thinks that i. 17–20 suit the great
drought in Josiah’s reign (Jer. xiv. 2–6), that the name given to the
locusts, <span class="heb">הצפוני</span>, ii. 20, is due to Jeremiah’s enemy <i>from the north</i>, and
that the phrases <i>return with all your heart</i>, ii. 12, and <i>return to Jehovah
your God</i>, 13, imply a period of apostasy. None of these conclusions
is necessary. The absence of reference to the <i>high places</i> finds an
analogy in Isa. i. 13; the <span class="heb">מנחה</span> is mentioned in Isa. i. 13: if Amos
viii. 5 testifies to observance of the Sabbath, and Nahum ii. 1 to other
festivals, who can say a pre-exilic prophet would not be interested in
the meal and drink offerings? But surely no pre-exilic prophet
would have so emphasised these as Joel has done. Nor is König’s
explanation of iv. 2 as of the Assyrian and Egyptian invasion of
Judah so probable as that which refers the verse to the Babylonian
exile. Nor are König’s objections to a date after “Malachi” convincing.
They are that a prophet near “Malachi’s” time must have specified as
“Malachi” did the reasons for the repentance to which he summoned
the people, while Joel gives none, but is quite general (ii. 13<i>a</i>). But
the change of attitude may be accounted for by the covenant and
Law of 444. “Malachi” i. 11 speaks of the Gentiles worshipping
Jehovah, but not even in Jonah iii. 5 is any relation of the Gentiles
to Jehovah predicated. Again, the greater exclusiveness of Ezra and
his Law may be the cause. Joel, it is true, as König says, does not
mention the Law, while “Malachi” does (ii. 8, etc.); but this was not
necessary if the people had accepted it in 444. Professor Ryle (<i>Canon
of O.T.</i>, 106 n.) leaves the question of Joel’s date open.</p>

pointed for the past, has evidently understood them as instances of
the prophetic perfect. But “this is grammatically indefensible”:
Driver, <i>in loco</i>; see his <i>Heb. Tenses</i>, § 82, <i>Obs.</i> Calvin and others,
who take the verbs of ver.&nbsp;18 as future, accept those of the next
verse as past and with it begin the narrative. But if God’s answer
to His people’s prayer be in the past, so must His jealousy and
pity. All these verbs are in the same sequence of time. Merx
proposes to change the vowel-points of the verbs and turn them into
futures. But see above, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_395">395</a>. ver.&nbsp;21 shows that Jehovah’s action
is past, and Nowack points out the very unusual character of the
construction that would follow from Merx’s emendation. Ewald,

<i>for righteousness</i>. A.&nbsp;There are those who take it as having a <i>moral</i>
reference; and (1) this is so emphatic to some that they render
the word for <i>early rain</i>, <span class="heb">מורה</span>,
which also means <i>teacher</i> or <i>revealer</i>,
in the latter significance. So (some of them applying it to the
Messiah) Targum, Symmachus, the Vulgate, <i>doctorem justitiæ</i>, some
Jews, <i>e.g.</i> Rashi and Abarbanel, and some moderns, <i>e.g.</i> (at opposite
extremes) Pusey and Merx. But, as Calvin points out (this is another
instance of his sanity as an exegete, and refusal to be led by
theological presuppositions: he says, “I do not love strained expositions”),
this does not agree with the context, which speaks not of
spiritual but wholly of physical blessings. (2) Some, who take <span class="heb">מורה</span>
as <i>early rain</i>, give <span class="heb">לצדקה</span> the meaning
<i>for righteousness</i>, <i>ad justitiam</i>,
either in the sense that God will give the rain as a token of His
own righteousness, or in order to restore or vindicate the people’s
righteousness (so Davidson, <i>Expositor</i>, 1888, I., p.&nbsp;203, n.), in the frequent
sense in which <span class="heb">צדקה</span> is employed in Isa. xl. ff.
(see <i>Isaiah xl.—lxvi.</i>, Expositor’s Bible,
pp.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43672/43672-h/43672-h.htm#Page_219">219</a> ff.).
Cf. Hosea x. 13, <span class="heb">צדק</span>; above, Vol. I., p.&nbsp;289,
n.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43847/43847-h/43847-h.htm#Footnote_611_611">611</a>.
This of course is possible, especially in view of Israel
having been made by their plagues a reproach among the heathen.
Still, if Joel had intended this meaning, he would have applied the
phrase, not to the <i>early rain</i> only, but to the whole series of blessings
by which the people were restored to their standing before God.
B. It seems, therefore, right to take <span class="heb">לצדקה</span>
in a purely physical sense,
of the measure or quality of the <i>early rain</i>. So even Calvin, <i>rain
according to what is just</i> or <i>fit</i>; A.V. <i>moderately</i> (inexact); R.V. <i>in
just measure</i>; Siegfried-Stade <i>sufficient</i>.
The root-meaning of <span class="heb">צדק</span> is
probably <i>according to norm</i> (cf. <i>Isaiah xl.—lxvi.</i>, p.&nbsp;215), and in that
case the meaning would be <i>rain of normal quantity</i>. This too suits
the parallel in the next clause: <i>as formerly</i>. In Himyaritic the word
is applied to good harvests. A man prays to God for <span class="heb">אפקל ואתֹמר צדקם</span>,
<i>full</i> or <i>good harvests and fruits</i>: <i>Corp. Inscr. Sem.</i>, Pars
Quarta, Tomus I., No. 2, lin. 1–5; cf. the note.</p>

Writing in the middle of the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
Herodotus has heard
of the Jews only as a people that practise circumcision and were
defeated by Pharaoh Necho at Megiddo (II. 104, 159; on the latter
passage see <i>Hist. Geog.</i>, p.&nbsp;405 n.). He does not even know them by
name. The fragment of Chœrilos of Samos, from the end of the
fifth century, which Josephus cites (<i>Contra Apionem</i>, I. 22) as a
reference to the Jews, is probably of a people in Asia Minor. Even
in the last half of the fourth century and before Alexander’s campaigns,
Aristotle knows of the Dead Sea only by a vague report
(<i>Meteor.</i>, II. iii. 39). His pupil Theophrastus (<i>d.</i> 287) names and
describes the Jews (Porphyr. <i>de Abstinentia</i>, II. 26; Eusebius, <i>Prepar.
Evang.</i>, IX. 2: cf. Josephus, <i>C. Apion.</i>, I. 22); and another pupil,
Clearchus of Soli, records the mention by Aristotle of a travelled Jew
of Cœle-Syria, but “Greek in soul as in tongue,” whom the great
philosopher had met, and learned from him that the Jews were
descended from the philosophers of India (quoted by Josephus,
<i>C. Apion.</i>, I. 22).</p>

was transferred to her successor Babylon (2 Kings xxiii. 29;
Jer. ii. 18; Lam. v. 6), and even to Babylon’s successor Persia
(Ezra vi. 22). When Seleucus secured what was virtually the old
Assyrian Empire with large extensions to Phrygia on the west and
the Punjaub on the east, the name would naturally be continued to his
dominion, especially as his first capital was Babylon, from his capture
of which in 312 the Seleucid era took its start. There is actual
record of this. Brugsch (<i>Gesch. Aeg.</i>, p.&nbsp;218) states that in the
hieroglyphic inscriptions of the Ptolemæan period the kingdom of
the Seleucids is called Asharu (cf. Stade, <i>Z.A.T.W.</i>, 1882, p.&nbsp;292,
and Cheyne, <i>Book of Psalms</i>, p.&nbsp;253, and <i>Introd. to Book of Isaiah</i>,
p.&nbsp;107, n.&nbsp;3). As the Seleucid kingdom shrank to this side of the
Euphrates, it drew the name Assyria with it. But in Greek mouths
this had long ago (cf. Herod.) been shortened to Syria: Herodotus
also appears to have applied it only to the west of the Euphrates.

it is common in Aramean; other

far as the Maccabean age, which is impossible if the prophetic canon
closed in 200 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and seeks for its origin in Egypt, “that land of
wonders,” on account of its fabulous character, and because of the
description of the east wind as <span class="heb">חרישׁית</span> (iv. 8), and the name of the

historicum sed ita ut in historia ipsa lateat maximi vaticinii mysterium,
atque ipse fatis suis, non minus quam effatis vatem se verum demonstret.”
Hitzig curiously thinks that this is the reason why it has
been placed in the Canon of the Prophets next to the unfulfilled
prophecy of God against Edom. But by the date which Hitzig assigns
to the book the prophecy against Edom was at least in a fair way
to fulfilment. Riehm (<i>Theol. Stud. u. Krit.</i>, 1862, pp.&nbsp;413 f.): “The
practical intention of the book is to afford instruction concerning the
proper attitude to prophetic warnings”; these, though genuine words
of God, may be averted by repentance. Volck (art. “Jona” in
Herzog’s <i>Real. Encycl.</i>²) gives the following. Jonah’s experience is
characteristic of the whole prophetic profession. “We learn from it
(1) that the prophet must perform what God commands him, however
unusual it appears; (2) that even death cannot nullify his calling;
(3) that the prophet has no right to the fulfilment of his prediction,
but must place it in God’s hand.” Vatke (<i>Einl.</i>, 688) maintains that
the book was written in an apologetic interest, when Jews expounded
the prophets and found this difficulty, that all their predictions
had not been fulfilled. “The author obviously teaches: (1)
since the prophet cannot withdraw from the Divine commission, he
is also not responsible for the contents of his predictions; (2) the
prophet often announces Divine purposes, which are not fulfilled,
because God in His mercy takes back the threat, when repentance
follows; (3) the honour of a prophet is not hurt when a threat is
not fulfilled, and the inspiration remains unquestioned, although many
predictions are not carried out.”
</p>
<p class="fnote2">
To all of which there is a conclusive answer, in the fact that, had
the book been meant to explain or justify unfulfilled prophecy, the
author would certainly not have chosen as an instance a judgment
against Niniveh, because, by the time he wrote, all the early predictions
of Niniveh’s fall had been fulfilled, we might say, to the
very letter.</p>

Bleek, Reuss, Cheyne, Wright, König, Farrar, Orelli, etc. So virtually

fundamental truth of the book is that “true fear and repentance
bring salvation from Jehovah.”</p>

Hermann v. d. Hardt (<i>Ænigmata Prisci Orbis</i>, 1723: cf. <i>Jonas in</i>
<i>Carcharia, Israel in Carcathio</i>, 1718, quoted by Vatke, <i>Einl.</i>, p.&nbsp;686)
found in the book a political allegory of the history of Manasseh led
into exile, and converted, while the last two chapters represent the
history of Josiah. That the book was symbolic in some way of
the conduct and fortunes of Israel was a view familiar in Great
Britain during the first half of this century: see the Preface to the
English translation of Calvin on Jonah (1847). Kleinert (in his
commentary on Jonah in Lange’s Series, Vol. XVI. English translation,
1874) was one of the first to expound with details the symbolising
of Israel in the prophet Jonah. Then came the article in the <i>Theol.
Review</i> (XIV. 1877, pp.&nbsp;214 ff.) by Cheyne, following Bloch’s <i>Studien
z. Gesch. der Sammlung der althebräischen Litteratur</i> (Breslau, 1876);
but adding the explanation of <i>the great fish</i> from Hebrew mythology
(see below). Von Orelli quotes Kleinert with approval in the main.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="Footnote_1488_1488" id="Footnote_1488_1488"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1488_1488">[1488]</a> That the Book of Jonah employs mythical elements is an opinion
that has prevailed since the beginning of this century. But before
Semitic mythology was so well known as it is now, these mythical
elements were thought to have been derived from the Greek mythology.
So Gesenius, De Wette, and even Knobel, but see especially
F. C. Baur in Ilgen’s <i>Zeitschrift</i> for 1837, p.&nbsp;201. Kuenen (<i>Einl.</i>, 424)
and Cheyne (<i>Theol. Rev.</i>, XIV.) rightly deny traces of any Greek
influence on Jonah, and their denial is generally agreed in.
</p>
<p class="fnote2">
Kleinert (<i>op. cit.</i>, p.&nbsp;10) points to the proper source in the native
mythology of the Hebrews: “The sea-monster is by no means
an unusual phenomenon in prophetic typology. It is the secular
power appointed by God for the scourge of Israel and of the earth
(Isa. xxvii. 1)”; and Cheyne (<i>Theol. Rev.</i>, XIV., “Jonah: a Study in
Jewish Folk-lore and Religion”) points out how Jer. li. 34, 44 f., forms
the connecting link between the story of Jonah and the popular
mythology.</p>

days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the
earth three days and three nights</i>—is not repeated in Luke xi. 29, 30,
which confines the sign to the preaching of repentance, and is
suspected as an intrusion both for this and other reasons, e.g. that
ver.&nbsp;40 is superfluous and does not fit in with ver.&nbsp;41, which gives the
proper explanation of the sign; that Jonah, who came by his burial
in the fish through neglect of his duty and not by martyrdom, could
not therefore in this respect be a type of our Lord. On the other
hand, ver.&nbsp;40 is not unlike another reference of our Lord to His
resurrection, John ii. 19 ff. Yet, even if ver.&nbsp;40 be genuine, the vagueness
of the parallel drawn in it between Jonah and our Lord surely
makes for the opinion that in quoting Jonah our Lord was not
concerned about quoting facts, but simply gave an illustration from
a well-known tale. Matt. xvi. 4, where the sign of Jonah is again
mentioned, does not explain the sign.</p>

the fate of the man who buried his talent, is this to commit us to the
belief that the personages of Christ’s parables actually existed? Or
take the homiletic use of Shakespeare’s dramas—“as Macbeth did,”
or “as Hamlet said.” Does it commit us to the historical reality of
Macbeth or Hamlet? Any preacher among us would resent being
bound by such an inference. And if we resent this for ourselves, how
chary we should be about seeking to bind our Lord by it.</p>

Jonah are those by Köhler in the <i>Theol. Rev.</i>, XVI. 139 ff., and by
Böhme in the <i>Z.A.T.W.</i>, VII. 224 ff. Köhler first insists on traits of
an earlier age (rude conception of God, no sharp boundary drawn
between heathens and the Hebrews, etc.), and then finds traces of a
late revision: lacuna in i.&nbsp;2; hesitation in iii. 1, in the giving of the
prophet’s commission, which is not pure Hebrew; change of three
days to forty (cf. LXX.); mention of unnamed king and his edict,
which is superfluous after the popular movement; beasts sharing
in mourning; also in i. 5, 8, 9, 14, ii. 2, <span class="heb">דָּגָה</span>,
iii. 9, iv. 1–4, as disturbing context; also the building of
a booth is superfluous, and only
invented to account for Jonah remaining forty days instead of the
original three; iv. 6, <span class="heb">להיות צל על ראשׁו</span> for an original <span class="heb">לְהַּצִּל לוֹ</span> = to offer him shade; 7, <i>the worm</i>,
<span class="heb">תולעת</span>, due to a copyist’s change of
the following <span class="heb">בעלות</span>. Withdrawing these, Köhler gets an account
of the sparing of Niniveh on repentance following a sentence of
doom, which, he says, reflects the position of the city of God in
Jeremiah’s time, and was due to Jeremiah’s opponents, who said in
answer to his sentence of doom: If Niniveh could avert her fate,
why not Jerusalem? Böhme’s conclusion, starting from the alleged
contradictions in the story, is that no fewer than four hands have
had to deal with it. A sufficient answer is given by Kuenen (<i>Einl.</i>,
426 ff.), who, after analysing the dissection, says that its “improbability
is immediately evident.” With regard to the inconsistencies
which Böhme alleges to exist in chap.&nbsp;iii. between ver.&nbsp;5 and vv. 6–9,
Kuenen remarks that “all that is needed for their explanation is
a little good-will”—a phrase applicable to many other difficulties
raised with regard to other Old Testament books by critical attempts
even more rational than those of Böhme. Cornill characterises
Böhme’s hypothesis as absurd.</p>

had, when he stood in such a battle with death.” We recognise in
this Psalm “the recollection of the confidence with which Jonah
hoped towards God, that since he had been rescued in so wonderful
a way from death in the waves, He would also bring him out of the
night of his grave into the light of day.”</p>

removed by transferring the words in ver.&nbsp;6, <i>and they cried a fast,
and from the greatest of them, to the least they clothed themselves in
sackcloth</i>, to the end of ver.&nbsp;8, with a <span class="heb">לאמר</span> or <span class="heb">ויאמרו</span> to introduce ver.&nbsp;9. But, as said above
(pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_499">499</a>, 510,
n.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote_1499_1499">1499</a>), it is more probable
that the text as it stands was original, and that the inconsistencies
in the order of the narrative are due to its being a tale or parable.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
